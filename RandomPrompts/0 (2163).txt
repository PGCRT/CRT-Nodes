A black and white photograph of a woman with long, wavy hair walking down a city street. She is wearing a black blazer, black pants, and red high heels. She has a black bag slung over her shoulder. The street is lined with shops and buildings, and there is a car parked on the right side of the image. The woman is facing away from the camera, with a serious expression on her face. The image is high quality and has a watermark in the bottom right corner.
