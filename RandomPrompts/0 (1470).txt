44. Cinematic image set in the Bronze Age Minoan era, conveying a mood of ritualistic devotion and ancient mystery. The subject is a dancer with a lean dancerâ€™s build, olive-toned skin with body paint, auburn hair in a fishtail braid, and no makeup with high cheekbones. The artistic style is inspired by Symbolism (Klimt), with a warm metallic palette of golds and bronzes. Shot on Panavision Panaflex System 65 with a Cooke S4/i 50mm lens, featuring soft blooming highlights and fine film grain. Profile shot, static, capturing the dancer performing in a frescoed hall, their expression serene with closed eyes.
