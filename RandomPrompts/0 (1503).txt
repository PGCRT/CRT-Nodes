Medium shot of a woman in her early 30s with shoulder-length chestnut hair, wearing a faded denim dress, standing on the porch of an abandoned farmhouse at sunset—golden light spills across weathered wood, and fields stretch into the distance. Camera slowly tracks forward as she opens a small, rusted tin, revealing a bundle of dried lavender—her expression softens, eyes glistening with memory. Close-up on her face as she inhales the scent, a tear catching the sunset’s glow—the fields blur into a warm wash of gold and green, isolating her in a moment of tender nostalgia.
