A photograph of two young women walking down a city street, both with fair skin and long brown hair. The woman on the left is wearing a dark blue top with a plunging neckline and white shorts, while the woman in the middle is wearing red and black patterned shorts with a brown crossbody bag. Both women have bags on their backs and are looking at the camera with a confident expression. The background shows a modern cityscape with tall buildings and a red and white train on the tracks. The image is high quality and has a watermark in the bottom left corner.
