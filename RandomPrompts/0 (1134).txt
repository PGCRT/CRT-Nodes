A woman with red hair standing in the doorway of a modern building, wearing a white dress with a floral pattern and brown sandals. She is holding a glass of beer in her hand. The building has large windows with reflective glass, and there are people walking by in the background. The lighting is bright and natural, casting shadows on the glass. The woman has a confident and relaxed expression. The image is taken from a low angle, looking up at the woman.
