Medium shot of a woman in her early 30s with curly, jet-black hair, wearing a deep purple cardigan, standing on the balcony of an old library at night—stars gleam above, and bookshelves cast long shadows through arched windows. Camera slowly dollies in as she pulls a small, leather-bound diary from her bag, her fingers brushing over a faded ribbon bookmark—her expression shifts from calm to haunted, eyes glistening with memory. Close-up on her eyes as she opens the diary, a tear catching the starlight—the library fades into a soft blur of indigo and silver, isolating her in a moment of silent revelation.
