Two women standing in a train station, engaged in a conversation. The woman on the left has long, wavy red hair and is wearing a dark blue quilted coat with a red and black handbag. She has fair skin and is looking at the other woman with a surprised expression. The other woman, with long, light brown hair and a black coat, is standing to the right of the two women. The background shows other passengers and a blue and white train. The image is slightly blurry, with a focus on the women and the train.
