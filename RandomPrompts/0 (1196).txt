(Thriller) A woman is walking down a city street. She notices that all the digital billboards and screens she passes are displaying a live feed of her, but from an angle directly behind her. She spins around to find no one there, then looks back at the screens to see the figure behind her is still there, now waving slowly. Modern paranoia, found-footage feel, high-dread.
