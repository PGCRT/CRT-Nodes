(Sci-Fi/Psychological) An astronaut on a solo mission to Mars begins to see a mysterious 'seam' running through the middle of his habitat, as if the world were a badly stitched-together image. He touches it, and his fingers phase through, revealing blackness and lines of code beneath. He is inside a simulation, and it's starting to break down. Truman Show in space, existential dread.
