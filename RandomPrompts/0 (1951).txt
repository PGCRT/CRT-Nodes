Medium shot of a woman in her late 20s with long, auburn hair, wearing a heavy gray shawl, standing by a mountain waterfall at dawn—mist rises from the cascade, and golden light pierces the trees. Camera slowly arcs around her as she opens a small, wooden box, revealing a single pressed leaf—her lips part, eyes softening with recognition. Close-up on her profile as a tear rolls down her cheek, catching the sunlight—the waterfall blurs into a radiant tapestry of green and gold, suspending her in a moment of quiet wonder.
