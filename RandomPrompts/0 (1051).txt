Photo of two women at a festival, one with long curly brown hair and the other with short blonde hair, both wearing colorful bracelets and scarves. The woman on the left is wearing a black crop top and a purple and yellow scarf, and is holding a bottle of beer in her hand. The other woman is standing next to her, smiling and looking at her. The background is blurred, but it appears to be a crowd of people. The lighting is bright and natural, coming from the left side of the image.
