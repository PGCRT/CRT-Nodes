A curvy woman with shoulder-length, curly black hair framing her face in a wild, noir cascade, wearing a tattered, black dress with jagged lace that accentuates her curvy figure and perky breasts, her pale skin glowing under dim, smoky streetlights, sketching in a notebook | pausing to light a cigarette while leaning against a brick wall in a rain-soaked alley with a blurred background of neon signs, wet cobblestones, and shadowy figures, her expressive red eyes focused on her drawing, a rusted silver locket glinting against her skin, the scene enriched by the patter of rain, the faint scent of tobacco, and the distant wail of a saxophone, her absorbed sketching exuding mystery, creating a candid, photorealistic noir video that captures her enigmatic allure and the moody, atmospheric tension of a gritty urban nightscape.
