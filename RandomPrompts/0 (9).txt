A curvy woman with long, curly crimson hair flowing freely down her back in wild, glowing waves, wearing a sheer, gothic fantasy dress with obsidian beads that reveals her toned midriff and natural breasts, her pale skin glowing with an eerie, moonlit pallor under flickering, silver torchlight, posing in a haunted cathedral with a blurred background of towering stained-glass windows, crumbling stone arches, and swirling mist, her sultry red eyes and neutral expression exuding quiet menace, a delicate onyx choker around her neck, the scene enriched by the distant toll of bells, the damp scent of stone, and the faint whisper of ghostly voices, creating a photorealistic gothic fantasy portrait that captures her sinister allure and the chilling, mystical atmosphere of a forsaken, sacred space.
