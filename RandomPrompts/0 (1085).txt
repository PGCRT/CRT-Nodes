A gritty close-up on the determined face of Maya, a rebel fighter in a dystopian, sterile city, as she plants a "data bomb" on a government propaganda tower. | She finishes setting the timer and turns to leave, but she is cornered by a heavily armed Enforcer in white armor. | The Enforcer raises his weapon, but then hesitates, looking at a small, hand-carved wooden bird she wears around her neck. He lowers his gun and whispers a secret rebel call sign, revealing he is a deep-cover agent sent to help her escape.
