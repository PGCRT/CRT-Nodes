Medium shot of a woman in her late 20s with jet-black hair tucked under a red knit scarf, wearing a heavy gray coat, standing on a stone bridge blanketed in fresh snow—twilight casts a soft violet glow, and a frozen river glints below. Camera slowly arcs around her as she opens a small velvet box, revealing a delicate silver ring nestled inside—her breath clouds in the cold air, her expression shifting from calm to wistful. Close-up on her face as she slips the ring onto her finger, a single tear freezing on her cheek—the snowflakes catch the fading light, and the bridge blurs into a serene, frosted dreamscape.
