A woman walking across a crosswalk in the rain, holding a large blue umbrella. She is wearing a long grey coat, a white shirt, and black boots. The background shows a city street with tall buildings, cars parked on the side, and a few pedestrians walking by. The sky is grey and cloudy, and the ground is wet, suggesting it's raining. The woman has a serious expression on her face. The image is high quality and has a watermark in the bottom right corner.
