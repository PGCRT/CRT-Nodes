A woman with long blonde hair tied in a high ponytail, wearing a long, light grey coat with a high collar and a belt. She is standing on a city street, facing away from the viewer, with her back to the camera. The background is blurred, but it appears to be a busy city street with buildings and people. The woman is holding a black bag in her left hand. The image has a soft, dreamy quality with a watermark in the bottom right corner.
