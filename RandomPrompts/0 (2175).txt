(Fantasy) A lone traveler walks through a petrified forest where all the trees are made of shimmering crystal. He taps a tree, and it rings with a beautiful, melodic note. He begins to tap other trees, creating a complex, enchanting symphony by playing the forest itself. A magical, auditory, and visual spectacle.
