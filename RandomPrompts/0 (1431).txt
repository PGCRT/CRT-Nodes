(Fantasy/Horror) A group of adventurers walk through a cave, their torches illuminating walls covered in what looks like intricate, beautiful murals. The camera slowly pushes in on one mural depicting a hunter. | As the adventurers' shadows fall upon the mural, the painted hunter's eyes follow them. | The shadow of one adventurer detaches from its owner, merges with the wall, and the painted hunter steps out of the mural, now a three-dimensional being of living shadow, raising its spear. High-concept horror, dynamic lighting, high tension.
