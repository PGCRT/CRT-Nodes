In a dark, noir city, a woman named "Ink," whose tattoos are magical and can come to life, is cornered in an alley. | The thugs closing in laugh at her tattoosâ€”a coiled serpent on one arm, a swooping hawk on the other. | She smirks, and the serpent tattoo peels off her skin, solidifying into a living, ink-black snake that lunges at the thugs, while the hawk tattoo launches from her other arm and soars into the sky to watch for escape routes.
