Medium shot of a woman in her early 30s with long, silver-blonde hair, wearing a heavy wool coat, standing in a frosted city alley at twilight—streetlights cast a soft glow, and snow dusts the cobblestones. Camera slowly dollies in as she kneels to pick up a small, frozen flower pressed against the wall—her breath clouds, eyes softening with memory. Close-up on her face as she holds the flower, a tear freezing on her cheek—the alley blurs into a serene wash of white and blue, suspending her in a moment of quiet sorrow.
