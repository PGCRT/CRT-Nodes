A woman lives alone in a house at the edge of the world, where the land crumbles into a sea of clouds. She is the "Edge-Keeper." | A small, lost child wanders out of the mist. | The woman doesn't take the child back, but instead begins to teach her how to navigate the cloud-sea and read the currents of the mist, training her successor.
