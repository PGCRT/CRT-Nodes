A poised woman with long, straight raven hair cascading past her hips in a glossy, silken sheet, wearing a plunging baroque gown with gold embroidery and velvet trim that showcases her full breasts and curvy hips, her smooth, olive skin shimmering under opulent, candlelit chandeliers, standing in a grand palace ballroom with a blurred background of marble columns, ornate frescoes, and gilded mirrors, her confident smile and piercing green eyes radiating regal allure, a delicate ruby-encrusted tiara glinting in her hair, the scene enriched by the soft rustle of silk, the faint scent of rosewater, and the distant strains of a harpsichord, creating a luxurious, photorealistic baroque portrait that captures her majestic beauty and the lavish, historical atmosphere of an aristocratic court.
