(Horror) A POV shot from someone buried alive in a cheap wooden coffin. We hear the dirt being shoveled onto the lid. He lights a match to see. The match illuminates the small space, revealing hundreds of deep, desperate scratch marks already covering the inside of the lid above him. He is not the first one in here. Claustrophobic, high-impact shock.
