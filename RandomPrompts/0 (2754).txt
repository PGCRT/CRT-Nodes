(Fantasy/Horror) A child sleeps soundly in their bed. The camera dollies slowly towards the closet. The closet door creaks open. Instead of a monster, a beautiful, Narnia-like snowy forest is visible inside. The 'monster' is that the beautiful world is slowly, malevolently spilling out, covering the bedroom floor in frost and creeping towards the sleeping child. Inverted trope, quiet horror.
