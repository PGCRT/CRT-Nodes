(Sci-Fi/Thriller) A scientist in a hazmat suit analyzes a writhing, black, symbiotic alien substance contained in a glass box. The slime suddenly lunges, phasing through the glass without breaking it. A POV shot from inside the scientist's helmet shows the black goo pouring in through the air vents, flowing towards his screaming face. Venom meets The Thing, claustrophobic horror.
