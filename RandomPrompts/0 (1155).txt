A woman with curly red hair standing in front of a black brick wall. She is wearing a brown leather jacket with a blue and gold patterned shawl draped over her shoulders. She has a serious expression and is holding a pair of sunglasses in her hands. The lighting is bright and natural, casting shadows on her face and body. The background is blurred, but it appears to be an outdoor setting. The image is taken from a low angle, looking up at the woman.
