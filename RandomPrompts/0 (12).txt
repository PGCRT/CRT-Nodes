Medium shot of a woman in her early 30s with curly, auburn hair, wearing a faded green jacket, standing at a deserted carnival stall at twilight—faded banners flutter, and fairy lights flicker faintly. Camera slowly tracks in as she picks up a small, dusty stuffed animal from the counter—her lips part, a flicker of nostalgia crossing her face. Close-up on her eyes as they well with tears, reflecting the carnival lights—the stall blurs into a dreamy wash of purple and gold, isolating her in a moment of bittersweet memory.
