A photograph of a young Asian woman with long brown hair and fair skin, wearing a white shirt and a grey sleeveless vest. She is standing in the foreground of the image, looking directly at the camera with a neutral expression. The background is blurred, but it appears to be a busy city street with other people and buildings. The woman has a slender build and is wearing a silver bracelet on her left wrist.
