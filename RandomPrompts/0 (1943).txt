A young woman walking down a cobblestone street in an urban setting. She is wearing a black parka with a fur-lined hood, a short blue denim skirt, and brown knee-high boots. The background features a brick building with a large circular window and a bicycle parked in the doorway. The woman has a serious expression on her face. The image is slightly blurred, giving it a dreamy quality.
