A struggling musician, Jessie, plays her electric guitar in a grimy subway station for spare change. Her music is good, but no one is listening. | A strange, cloaked figure drops a weird, pulsating guitar pick into her case. | She shrugs and uses the new pick. The moment it hits the strings, her guitar unleashes a wave of pure sonic energy that shatters every lightbulb in the station and makes everyone drop to their knees in awe.
