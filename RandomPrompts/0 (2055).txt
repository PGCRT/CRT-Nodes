Close-up on Maren's flour-dusted hands as she kneads a ball of dough; she pauses, then from a small, unlabeled jar she sprinkles a pinch of shimmering, golden dust into the dough and works it in, a gentle, knowing smile on her face. | A time-lapse shot shows the loaf of bread rising in the oven, glowing faintly from within; she pulls the perfectly golden-brown loaf out, the smell of fresh bread and something more—like forgotten joy—filling the air. | A sad, weary-looking man buys the loaf, and as he takes the first bite outside the shop, a look of surprise and then pure, unadulterated happiness washes over his face as a long-lost happy memory is unlocked by the magical bread.
