A low-angle shot captures a powerful warrior queen, Isolde, in full, dark-plate armor, standing before a massive, chained, and sleeping dragon in a subterranean chamber. Her face is grim. | Her spies have told her an enemy army is marching on her city. She holds a contract written in bloodâ€”a pact made by her ancestors to never wake the beast. | After a long, silent moment of decision, she tears the ancient contract in half, takes her greatsword, and strikes the massive chain, the ringing sound echoing like a death knell as the dragon's colossal, molten-gold eye snaps open.
