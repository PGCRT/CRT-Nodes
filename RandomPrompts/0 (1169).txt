Medium shot of a woman in her late 20s with wavy, copper hair, wearing a quilted navy jacket, standing on a deserted pier at dawn—mist rises from the water, and a faint pink glow bathes the horizon. Camera slowly tracks in as she pulls a small, tarnished ring from her pocket, her fingers tracing its worn surface—her expression shifts from calm to wistful. Close-up on her eyes as they well with tears, the sunrise reflecting in her pupils—the pier blurs into a serene haze of pink and gray, isolating her in a moment of silent longing.
