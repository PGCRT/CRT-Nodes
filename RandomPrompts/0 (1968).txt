(Action/Musical) A massive bar brawl breaks out. The camera follows a hero who fights his way through the chaos. But every punch, kick, thrown chair, and shattering bottle is perfectly synchronized to the beat of a fast-paced, bombastic swing-music track playing on the jukebox. A highly choreographed, violent, and rhythmic action-musical sequence.
