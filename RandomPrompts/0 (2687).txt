Medium shot of a woman in her early 30s with curly, silver hair, wearing a navy wool sweater, standing in an abandoned factory loft at dawn—sunlight streams through broken windows, illuminating dust motes. Camera slowly dollies in as she approaches a dusty table, retrieving a small, cracked mirror—her face stills, eyes shimmering with recognition. Close-up on her eyes as they reflect the mirror’s surface, a tear catching the sunlight—the loft blurs into a hazy mix of gray and gold, isolating her in a moment of quiet reflection.
