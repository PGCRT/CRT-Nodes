A radiant woman with long, cascading platinum blonde hair flowing in shimmering, steam-powered coils past her waist, wearing a form-fitting steampunk corset dress with brass gears and leather straps that clings to her curvy figure, accentuating her full breasts and toned hips, her smooth, porcelain skin glowing under warm, gaslit chandelier light, standing in a grand airship hangar with a blurred background of polished copper pipes, whirring propellers, and smoky skies, her piercing emerald eyes sparkling with adventurous intensity, lips parted in a subtle smile, a delicate clockwork pendant resting against her collarbone, the air thick with the scent of oil and steam, her poised stance exuding elegance, creating a breathtaking, photorealistic steampunk portrait that captures her ethereal beauty and the vibrant, mechanical atmosphere of a retro-futuristic world at dusk.
