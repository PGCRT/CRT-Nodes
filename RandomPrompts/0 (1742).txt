A blonde woman and a black man riding bicycles on a path in a park. The woman is wearing a blue tank top and black leggings, while the man is wearing black shorts and a white helmet. The path is lined with trees and grass on both sides. The background is slightly blurred, but it appears to be a sunny day with a clear blue sky. The image is taken from a low angle, looking up at the two cyclists.
