A woman standing in front of a store, wearing a long, light pink puffer coat, a white beanie, and black boots. She is holding a pink and white striped bag in one hand and a piece of paper in the other. The store has large glass windows with posters on them, and there are purple flowers hanging from the windows. The woman has a serious expression on her face. The image is taken from a low angle, looking up at the store.
