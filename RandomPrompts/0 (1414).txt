In a fantasy world, a woman named Brenna, a "truth-sayer" who is magically compelled to be honest, is brought before a tyrannical king to be interrogated. | The king asks her, "Am I a great and just ruler?" The magic compels her to answer. | She looks him dead in the eye and says, "No. You are a small, frightened man who mistakes fear for respect." The entire court gasps in horror, but the king, who has never heard an honest word in his life, just stares, utterly fascinated and intrigued by her defiance.
