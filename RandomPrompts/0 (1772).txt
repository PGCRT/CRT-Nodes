In a fantasy world, a young woman, Elspeth, is an apprentice to a "dream-painter," an artist who can paint visions that predict the future. | Her master gives her a blank canvas and tells her to paint what she sees. She paints a beautiful, idyllic vision of the city celebrating a festival with fireworks. | Her master looks at the finished painting not with pride, but with absolute terror. "You've painted the festival," he whispers, "but you've forgotten to paint the sky." She looks back at her painting, and now sees what he sees: her beautiful fireworks are not exploding in the sky, but are arcing downwards, revealing they are actually the burning projectiles of an incoming artillery barrage.
