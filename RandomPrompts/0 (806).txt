In a dark, Gothic city, a woman named Isadora is a "shadow-tailor." She can literally cut and sew shadows to alter their shape. | A wealthy client asks her to alter his shadow to look more intimidating and powerful. She does so, expertly cutting and stitching the darkness into the shape of a winged demon. | The client pays her and leaves, but as he walks away, his new, monstrous shadow begins to move independently, reaching out with its clawed hands towards its unsuspecting owner.
