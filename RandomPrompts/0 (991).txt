A young woman with long curly black hair, wearing a denim jacket and jeans, leaning against a concrete wall in front of a store window. She is holding a small camera in her left hand and a black crossbody bag in her right hand. The store window has the name "ANN TAYLOR" written in white. There is a sign on the window that says "Find love at first the petites" and a disposable cup on the sidewalk next to her. The background shows a busy street with people walking by. The image has a watermark in the bottom left corner.
