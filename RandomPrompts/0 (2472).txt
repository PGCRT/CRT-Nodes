A woman with long blonde hair wearing black leather pants and silver boots, walking a small dog on a leash. She is wearing sunglasses and has a confident expression. The woman is accompanied by a man with a bald head and a light skin tone. The scene is set in an outdoor park with lush greenery and a red canopy. There are several people in the background, some sitting and some standing, enjoying the scenery. The image is slightly blurred, with a watermark in the bottom right corner.
