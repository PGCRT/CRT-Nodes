In a dark, mist-shrouded forest, a young woman named Elara, a druid-in-training, searches for a rare moonpetal flower. She is guided by the faint, silvery light it emits. | She finds the flower growing in the claw-like roots of a massive, dead tree. As she reaches for it, the roots snap shut like a trap, holding her fast, and the flower's light extinguishes, plunging her into darkness. | A low, ancient, earthy chuckle echoes around her. A face of bark and moss forms on the trunk of the tree, its eyes glowing with green light. The ancient forest spirit speaks, "You have sought my power, little druid. Now, you will prove you are worthy of it."
