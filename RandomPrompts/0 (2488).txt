Medium shot of a woman in her late 20s with long, auburn hair flowing freely, wearing a sage-green cloak, standing in an overgrown cemetery at dawn—moss clings to weathered tombstones, and golden light filters through twisted branches. Camera slowly tracks forward as she kneels beside a cracked gravestone, her fingers brushing away ivy to reveal a carved name—her face stills, a faint smile breaking through her sorrow. Close-up on her eyes as they shimmer with unshed tears, the sunlight catching the moisture on her lashes—the cemetery blurs into a dreamy haze of green and gold, framing her in a moment of quiet reverence.
