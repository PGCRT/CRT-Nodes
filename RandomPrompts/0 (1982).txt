(Horror) A young couple is looking at their new baby through a nursery window. They coo and smile. The camera slowly dollies in on the baby in the crib. It is sleeping peacefully. It's a perfect baby, except that when it breathes, its chest doesn't rise and fallâ€”it gently, rhythmically pulses with a soft, internal, reddish light. Subtle body horror, deeply unsettling.
