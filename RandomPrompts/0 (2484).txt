36. Hyperrealistic image set in an Alien Civilization, radiating a mood of otherworldly awe and quiet curiosity. The subject is an emissary with an androgynous frame, crystalline-textured skin, opalescent hair in sculptural avant-garde style, and avant-garde makeup with bejeweled eyes. The artistic style is inspired by sci-fi concept art (Syd Mead), with a cool metallic palette of silvers and blues. Shot on IMAX MSM 9802 with a wide-angle 18mm lens, featuring deep depth of field and subtle lens flares. Eye-level medium shot, static, capturing the emissary presenting a glowing artifact, their expression intrigued with wide eyes.
