A woman with long blonde hair, wearing a brown and black patterned dress, sitting on a black plastic chair in an outdoor cafe. She is wearing black sunglasses and has a black crossbody bag slung over her shoulder. Her legs are crossed, and she is looking down at her phone. There is a red tablecloth and a glass of water on the table. The background shows a cream-colored building with a black railing and a red and white patterned umbrella.
