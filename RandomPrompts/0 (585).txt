A youthful woman with shoulder-length, wavy platinum blonde hair framing her delicate face in soft, tousled strands, wearing a delicate coral-pink bra and matching panties with floral embroidery that highlight her perky breasts and slim physique, her fair skin radiant with a soft, ethereal sheen under diffused daylight streaming through a large arched window, standing in a cozy attic room with a blurred background of weathered wooden beams, plush beige rugs, and scattered vintage books, her expressive blue eyes gazing softly at the viewer, lips parted in a sultry expression, a faint blush on her cheeks adding warmth, the scene alive with the gentle creak of floorboards and the faint scent of old paper, creating a photorealistic moment of intimate serenity.
