(Surreal/Romance) A man and a woman dance a passionate tango in a grand ballroom. But as they twirl and dip, they begin to phase and glitch, their bodies momentarily becoming transparent, revealing the skeletons dancing within. The other dancers in the ballroom are all just beautifully dressed skeletons. Macabre romance, baroque style, bittersweet.
