Two young women walking hand in hand in a city square. The woman on the left has long brown hair and is wearing a pink scarf around her neck. She is smiling and appears to be in her early twenties. The other woman, with long blonde hair and a light blue coat, is also smiling. Both women are wearing casual clothing. The background shows a large yellow building with a curved roof and a clear blue sky. The image is framed with a black border.
