Two women at an outdoor cafe, one with blue hair and the other with brown hair, both with fair skin. The woman on the left is wearing a brown and orange patterned dress and is drinking from a blue and white soda can. She is holding a phone in her hand and appears to be taking a sip from it. The other woman, on the right, has a fair skin tone and is also wearing a blue overalls and a black tank top. Both women are smiling and looking at each other. The background shows a blurred outdoor setting with tables and chairs.
