Medium shot of a woman in her late 20s with wavy, honey-blonde hair, wearing a burgundy scarf, sitting on a park bench at dusk—autumn leaves drift around her, and city lights begin to glow in the distance. Camera slowly pushes in as she opens a small, velvet box, revealing a single pearl necklace—her expression shifts from calm to wistful, eyes glistening faintly. Close-up on her eyes as they well with tears, reflecting the city’s glow—the park blurs into a warm blur of orange and gray, suspending her in a moment of silent longing.
