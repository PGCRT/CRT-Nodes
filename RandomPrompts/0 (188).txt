A woman in a red coat and blue beanie with a fluffy pom-pom, standing in front of a building with a sign that says "Cepa" and "Vladimir Putin". She is facing away from the viewer, with her back to the camera. The background shows a city street with buildings, trees, and a clear sky. The image is framed with a black border.
