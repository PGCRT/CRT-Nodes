A gritty, handheld shot captures "Wrench," a tough female mechanic, standing in the engine room of a massive, continent-crawling city-vehicle, the air thick with steam and the smell of diesel. She wipes grease from her brow with the back of her hand, looking up at the colossal, failing piston with a look of grim determination. | With a guttural yell, she uses a massive, custom-built wrench to manually force the seized, bus-sized piston back into its cycle, her muscles straining to their absolute limit. The engine sputters, groans, and then catches, its rhythm smoothing out. | Exhausted, she leans against the engine block for a moment of relief, but then notices a fresh, deep scratch on the piston casing that wasn't there beforeâ€”a single, massive claw mark, as if something huge, alive, and angry inside the engine had tried to resist her.
