A cinematic shot of a young, idealistic "weather-witch," Lyra, standing on a parched, cracked riverbed under a mercilessly hot sun. The land is dying from a magical drought. | She performs a desperate, forbidden ritual, cutting her own palm and letting her blood drip onto the dry earth, chanting for rain. The sky remains clear and mocking. | Defeated, she collapses. But where her blood fell, a single, impossibly vibrant green vine sprouts, then another, and another. They don't grow upwards, but slither across the ground like snakes, heading directly for the nearby corrupt Baron's castle, and she realizes she didn't summon rain; she summoned an ancient, vengeful nature spirit.
