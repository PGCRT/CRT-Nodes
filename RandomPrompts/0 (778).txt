39. Hyperrealistic image set in a Cyberpunk 2077 slum, evoking a mood of gritty survival and quiet defiance. The subject is a scavenger with a compact and muscular body, rough weathered skin spattered with dirt, neon green hair in a faux hawk, and graphic eyeliner with a high-fashion editorial look. The artistic style is inspired by sci-fi concept art (Syd Mead), with a neon palette of pinks, blues, and purples. Shot on Blackmagic URSA Mini Pro with an anamorphic 50mm lens, featuring streaky flares and digital noise. Dutch angle, static, capturing the scavenger rummaging through a pile of tech debris, their expression determined with a clenched jaw.
