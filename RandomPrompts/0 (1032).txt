A woman wearing a brown fur coat and a black beanie, standing in a fish market. She is facing away from the viewer, with her arms crossed. The store has large windows, allowing for a clear view of the fish. The fish are hanging from the ceiling, and there is a black bag on the floor next to her. The lighting is dim, casting shadows on the scene. The woman has pale skin, and the overall mood is somber.
