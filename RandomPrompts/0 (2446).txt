A young Asian woman with long black hair and fair skin, wearing a black leather jacket and a black face mask. She is standing in front of a red tent, with her arms crossed, looking directly at the camera with a neutral expression. The background is blurred, with a hint of greenery and a red canopy. The lighting is soft and natural, casting gentle shadows. The image has a high-quality, professional feel.
