A woman sitting on a concrete bench in the middle of the street, wearing a tight, red dress. She is holding a smartphone in her hands, looking at it with a serious expression. The background is dark and minimalistic, with a brick pavement at the bottom. The lighting is soft and diffused, casting gentle shadows. The woman has fair skin and a slender build. The image has a high-quality, professional feel.
