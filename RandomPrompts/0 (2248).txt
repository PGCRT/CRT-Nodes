A radiant woman with long, cascading platinum blonde hair flowing in shimmering, cyberpunk strands past her waist, wearing a sleek, neon-purple bodysuit with glowing circuit patterns that clings to her curvy figure, accentuating her full breasts and toned hips, her smooth, porcelain skin glowing under pulsating, blue-hued neon lights, tweaking a holographic interface | dodging a sudden spark from a malfunctioning drone in a cluttered cyberworkshop with a blurred background of flickering data screens, buzzing machinery, and a neon-lit cityscape through a cracked window, her piercing blue eyes locked on her task, a delicate digital implant glinting on her temple, the air thick with the scent of solder and ozone, her agile movements exuding precision, the scene alive with the hum of electronics, the crackle of static, and distant sirens, creating a candid, photorealistic cyberpunk video that captures her technical focus and the vibrant, chaotic atmosphere of a futuristic tech hub at night.
