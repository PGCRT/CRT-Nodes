The image shows a group of four young women walking on a cobblestone street in Prague, Czech Republic. They are all wearing casual clothes, with one woman wearing a white jacket and black pants, another wearing a gray shirt and blue jeans, and the third wearing a black shirt and white jacket. The women have long blonde hair and are all smiling. In the background, there are other people walking, some carrying bags, and a large clock tower with a clock face. The street is lined with trees and buildings. The sky is clear and bright.
