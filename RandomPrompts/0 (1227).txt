(Sci-Fi/Horror) A salvage crew cuts open the hull of a ghost ship drifting in deep space. The camera POV is from inside the ship, looking out through the new hole. | The crew's helmet lights illuminate the interior, revealing the previous crew fused into the walls, their bodies stretched and twisted into grotesque, organic sculptures, their faces frozen in silent screams. | One of the fused figures' eyes suddenly snaps open and looks directly at the camera. Event Horizon-style body horror, terrifying reveal.
