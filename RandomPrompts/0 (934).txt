(Fantasy/Comedy) A tiny, grumpy gnome is trying to fish in a pond. His fishing line goes taut. He struggles, pulling with all his might. A crane shot pulls back to reveal he has hooked the nostril of a colossal, sleeping dragon, whose head forms the entire landscape of hills and valleys around the pond. The gnome's annoyed expression doesn't change.
