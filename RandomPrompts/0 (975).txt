A photograph of two women standing in front of a store window, engaged in a conversation. The woman on the left is a woman with long brown hair, wearing a black coat and holding a small black handbag. She appears to be in her mid-twenties, with a slim body and a neutral expression. The mannequin on the right is wearing a pink diamond-patterned shirt and blue jeans. The store window has a large orange circular design, and the reflection of the two women can be seen in the glass. The scene is bustling with activity, with people walking and sitting in the background.
