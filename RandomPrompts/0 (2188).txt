A curvy woman with long, curly crimson hair flowing freely down her back in wild, blood-red waves, wearing a tattered, sheer black dress with jagged lace that reveals her toned midriff and natural breasts, her pale skin glowing with an eerie, ghostly pallor under flickering, ominous candlelight, posing in a haunted mansion with a blurred background of cracked mirrors, cobweb-covered chandeliers, and shadowed corridors, her sultry red eyes and neutral expression exuding quiet menace, a subtle scar on her cheek adding dark intrigue, the scene enriched by the creak of floorboards, the faint scent of decay, and the distant howl of wind, creating a photorealistic dark horror portrait that captures her sinister allure and the chilling, foreboding atmosphere of a gothic nightmare.
