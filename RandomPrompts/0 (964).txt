11. Cinematic image set in the Gothic Victorian era, conveying a mood of eerie mystery and suppressed longing. The subject is a poet with a soft and rounded body, pale ivory skin with rosacea, jet black hair in a Gibson tuck, and gothic makeup with deep vampy lipstick. The artistic style is inspired by Tim Burtonâ€™s gothic fantasy, with a high-contrast monochrome palette. Shot on Arriflex 435 with a Petzval 85mm lens, featuring swirly bokeh and heavy vignetting. Over-the-shoulder shot, static, showing the poet writing by candlelight, their expression mournful with a single tear.
