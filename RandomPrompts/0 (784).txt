1. Photorealistic image set in the Stone Age, evoking a mood of primal survival and quiet awe. The subject is a hunter with a brawny body, rough weathered skin with tribal body paint, jet black hair in messy dreadlocks, and no makeup with a prominent scar across the cheek. The artistic style is inspired by gritty realism, with a muted earth-toned palette. Shot on RED Komodo with a wide-angle 18mm lens, featuring heavy film grain and soft vignetting. Low-angle wide shot, static, framing the hunter crouching by a campfire, clutching a flint spear, their expression vigilant with narrowed eyes.
