Medium shot of a woman in her late 20s with short, copper hair, wearing a worn leather jacket, standing on a deserted train platform at dusk—faint lights flicker along rusted tracks, and a distant whistle hums. Camera slowly pushes in as she pulls a faded train ticket from her pocket, her fingers brushing over its smudged date—her lips part, a flicker of nostalgia crossing her face. Close-up on her profile as a tear rolls down her cheek, catching the golden sunset—the platform fades into a warm blur of amber and shadow, suspending her in a moment of silent memory.
