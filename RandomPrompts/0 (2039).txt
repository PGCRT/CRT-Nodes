15. Hyperrealistic image set in a Dark Fantasy forest, evoking a mood of eerie enchantment and quiet dread. The subject is a sorceress with a lithe and willowy body, pale ivory skin with faint scars, deep burgundy hair in a waterfall braid, and gothic makeup with deep vampy lipstick. The artistic style is inspired by Tim Burtonâ€™s gothic fantasy, with a low-key dark and shadowy palette. Shot on RED Komodo with a Petzval 85mm lens, featuring swirly bokeh and heavy vignetting. High-angle close-up, static, capturing the sorceress casting a spell with glowing runes, her expression fierce with glowing eyes.
