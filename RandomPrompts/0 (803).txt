Medium shot of a woman in her early 30s with long, raven hair, wearing a wool navy coat, standing on a wooden dock by a misty lake at dawn—reeds sway gently, and the water mirrors a pale pink sky. Camera dollies in as she kneels to retrieve a small, waterlogged journal from the dock’s edge—her breath catches, fingers trembling as she opens a soggy page. Close-up on her eyes as they well with tears, the dawn light catching the moisture—the lake blurs into a serene haze of pink and gray, framing her in a moment of tender sorrow.
