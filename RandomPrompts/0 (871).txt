Medium shot of a woman in her early 30s with sleek, jet-black hair, wearing a red trench coat, standing in a bustling street market at night—neon signs pulse, and steam rises from food stalls. Camera slowly dollies in as she pulls a small, embroidered handkerchief from her pocket, her fingers tracing a monogram—her brow furrows, eyes flickering with longing. Close-up on her face as a tear catches the neon glow, reflecting vibrant pinks and blues—the market blurs into a vibrant tapestry of color and light, suspending her in a moment of silent yearning.
