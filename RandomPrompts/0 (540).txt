(Action/Fantasy) A whip-pan transition sequence. An elven archer releases an arrow. The camera follows the arrow in flight. As it passes a tree, the camera whip-pans to a dwarven warrior emerging from behind the tree, his axe already swinging. It pans from the axe to the troll it strikes, then from the troll's falling body to a wizard on a cliff above, who is already casting the next spell. A seamless, interconnected battle sequence.
