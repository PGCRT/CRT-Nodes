Medium shot of a woman in her early 30s with curly, chestnut hair, wearing a sage-green dress, standing in an abandoned greenhouse at sunrise—cracked glass panes let in golden light, and vines drape over rusted frames. Camera slowly pushes in as she approaches a dusty table, retrieving a small, cracked porcelain vase—her expression shifts from curious to wistful. Close-up on her face as she brushes dust from the vase, a tear catching the sunlight—the greenhouse blurs into a dreamy haze of green and gold, framing her in a moment of tender nostalgia.
