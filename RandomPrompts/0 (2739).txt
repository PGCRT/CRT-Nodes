A tracking shot follows a woman named 'Wrench', a mechanic on a massive, continent-crawling city-vehicle, as she navigates the noisy, steam-filled engine room. | She finds the source of a power drain: a strange, organic, vine-like growth has wrapped itself around a primary power conduit, pulsing with a soft green light. | She prepares to cut it away, but as she gets close, the vine projects a soft, holographic image into the airâ€”a beautiful, lush, green forest. She realizes the city was built on the last seed of a dead world, and killing the vine will kill the last hope of a long-lost ecosystem.
