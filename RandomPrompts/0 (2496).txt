(Historical/Comedy) A chaotic, single-take shot inside the scriptorium of a medieval monastery. A young monk, tasked with illuminating a manuscript, accidentally spills a pot of ink. To hide his mistake from the stern abbot, he enlists the help of other monks in a frantic, silent-film-style caper to clean the mess, creating an even bigger one in the process. Slapstick, historically detailed, charming.
