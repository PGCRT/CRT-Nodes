Medium shot of a woman in her late 20s with vibrant red hair piled loosely atop her head, wearing a simple white linen shirt and worn jeans, kneeling on the floor of a forgotten attic—a single shaft of afternoon light cuts through a grimy circular window, illuminating a dance of swirling dust motes | Camera slowly pushes in as she carefully lifts the lid of an old wooden chest, a faint scent of cedar and time rising from within—her hands move past folded linens and yellowed letters before her fingers close around a small, tarnished silver music box | Close-up on her face as she winds the small key and the box opens with a delicate, tinkling melody—the beam of light catches the tiny, spinning ballerina inside, casting a moving reflection across her features as her eyes soften, a ghost of a smile touching her lips while the attic blurs into a hazy, warm memory
