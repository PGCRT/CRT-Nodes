A poised woman with long, wavy auburn hair flowing freely down her back in soft, pastoral waves, wearing a sheer, white linen dress with floral embroidery that clings to her voluptuous breasts and slender waist, her flawless, tanned skin illuminated by soft, golden sunlight, obliviously harvesting lavender with delicate shears in a sprawling field with a blurred background of rolling hills, buzzing bees, and a distant farmhouse, her calm brown eyes focused on her task, a delicate pearl ring on her finger catching the light, the scene enriched by the sweet scent of lavender, the gentle hum of insects, and the soft rustle of grass, her careful harvesting exuding care, creating a candid, photorealistic pastoral portrait that captures her timeless beauty and the serene, idyllic atmosphere of a sunlit countryside.
