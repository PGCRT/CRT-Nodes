29. Cinematic image set in the Roman Empire, conveying a mood of imperial grandeur and quiet tension. The subject is a senator with a stocky body, olive-toned skin with faint wrinkles, jet black hair in a short crop, and no makeup with a cleft chin. The artistic style is inspired by Baroque oil painting (Caravaggio), with a warm metallic palette of golds and bronzes. Shot on Panavision Panaflex System 65 (65mm) with a Cooke S4/i 50mm lens, featuring soft blooming highlights and fine film grain. Profile shot, static, showing the senator standing in a marble forum, holding a scroll, their expression calculating with a furrowed brow.
