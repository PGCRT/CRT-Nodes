6. Hyperrealistic image set in the Golden Age of Piracy, radiating a mood of reckless adventure and quiet desperation. The subject is a pirate captain with a stocky body, rough weathered skin spattered with blood, ash brown hair in a messy ponytail, and no makeup with a crooked nose. The artistic style is inspired by Spaghetti Western, with a high-contrast teal and orange palette. Shot on Panavision Panaflex GII with a wide-angle 18mm lens, featuring heavy vignetting and chromatic aberration. Low-angle wide shot, static, capturing the captain at the shipâ€™s wheel during a storm, their expression fierce with gritted teeth.
