3. Hyperrealistic image set in the French Rococo era, radiating a mood of playful elegance and hidden longing. The subject is a noblewoman with a voluptuous and curvaceous body, dewy luminous skin with faint beauty marks, strawberry blonde hair in a French twist, and classic red lipstick with contoured cheekbones. The artistic style is inspired by Impressionism (Monet), with a pastel palette. Shot on Canon C500 Mark II with a Leica Summilux-C 85mm lens, featuring creamy bokeh and soft-focus filter. Profile shot, static, showing the noblewoman gazing out a window with lace curtains, her expression wistful with a soft frown.
