In a dark, rain-swept alley in a city of perpetual night, a woman named Lilith runs a hidden tattoo parlor. Her clients are not human. | A nervous-looking vampire comes in, asking for a tattoo that will protect him from the sun. Lilith prepares a special ink mixed with silver dust and her own blood. | As her needle touches his skin, the ink doesn't just sit on the surface; it burns and sinks in, creating a glowing, silver filigree that spreads across his veins. He looks at his hand, and it no longer smokes in the faint light from the doorway, and a look of tearful, impossible hope dawns on his face.
