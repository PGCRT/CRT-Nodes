(Microscopic/Awe) An epic, cinematic journey following a single neuron firing inside a human brain. The camera flies alongside the electrical impulse, treating the axon pathways like interstellar highways and the synapses like exploding nebulae of color and light. A visualization of a thought being born, set to a powerful orchestral score. Breathtaking, abstract, educational.
