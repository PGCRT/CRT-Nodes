POV shot from the head-mounted camera of Dr. Kenna Sharma, an urban explorer, as she rappels into the cavernous, silent cooling tower of a decommissioned nuclear power plant. Her breath echoes in her helmet as her light beam cuts through the oppressive darkness. | She reaches the bottom and finds something impossible: in the center of the vast concrete floor, a single, massive, ancient oak tree is growing, its leaves a pale, ghostly white and faintly glowing. The air is cold and still. | She cautiously approaches the tree and touches its bark; the instant her glove makes contact, the tree's bioluminescence flares violently, and every shadow in the massive tower stretches and solidifies into a shrieking, vaguely human shape, rushing towards her.
