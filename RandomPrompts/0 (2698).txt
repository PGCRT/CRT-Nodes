28. Photorealistic image set in a Dieselpunk airbase, radiating a mood of rugged determination and mechanical grit. The subject is a pilot with a compact and muscular body, rough weathered skin spattered with grease, ash brown hair in a pompadour, and no makeup with a crooked nose. The artistic style is inspired by gritty realism, with a high-contrast teal and orange palette. Shot on RED V-Raptor with a wide-angle 18mm lens, featuring heavy film grain and chromatic aberration. Ground-level shot, static, framing the pilot leaning against a propeller plane, their expression steely with a clenched jaw.
