30. Hyperrealistic image set in a Biopunk laboratory, radiating a mood of clinical curiosity and unsettling ambition. The subject is a geneticist with a lean and wiry body, translucent veiny skin, teal hair in a sleek high ponytail, and cybernetic facial seams with a high-fashion editorial look. The artistic style is inspired by sci-fi concept art (Syd Mead), with a sickly green and yellow palette. Shot on Sony FX9 with a macro 100mm lens, featuring digital noise and shallow depth of field. Eye-level medium shot, static, capturing the geneticist examining a bio-engineered plant, their expression intrigued with a raised eyebrow.
