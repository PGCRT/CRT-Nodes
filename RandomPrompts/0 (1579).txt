A young woman with long brown hair, wearing large black sunglasses, standing with her arms crossed in front of a green wall adorned with posters. She has a serious expression and is looking directly at the camera. The background is slightly blurred, suggesting a city setting. The woman is wearing a gray sweater and has a black bag slung over her shoulder. The posters on the wall add to the overall aesthetic of the image.
