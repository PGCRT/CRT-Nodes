A sharp-eyed woman with sleek, platinum-blonde hair pulled into a tight ponytail, wearing a glossy black trench coat with a high collar that frames her angular jawline, her pale skin illuminated by the faint glow of a cigarette, interrogating a suspect with a piercing stare and a notepad in hand | ducking under a flickering neon sign in a rain-soaked cyberpunk alley with a blurred background of holographic billboards, rusted fire escapes, and the shimmer of wet pavement, her icy blue eyes narrowed in suspicion, a thin silver bracelet glinting on her wrist, the air thick with the scent of rain and burnt circuits, her commanding presence exuding intensity, the scene alive with the buzz of electricity, the splash of puddles, and the distant hum of drones, creating a candid, photorealistic cyber-noir video that captures her relentless pursuit and the gritty, futuristic atmosphere of a dystopian city at midnight.
