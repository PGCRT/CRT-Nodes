31. Photorealistic image set in the Industrial Revolution, radiating a mood of gritty toil and quiet resilience. The subject is a factory worker with a heavy-set body, rough weathered skin with dirt, ash brown hair in a messy bun, and no makeup with laugh lines. The artistic style is inspired by Italian Neorealism, with a sepia-toned palette. Shot on Arriflex 435 (35mm) with a spherical 50mm lens, featuring visible dust and scratches and heavy vignetting. Ground-level shot, static, framing the worker operating a steam-powered loom, their expression tired with a furrowed brow.
