(Surreal/Existential) A person stands on a beach where the sand is made of billions of tiny, ticking clock faces. The ocean is not water, but a slow-moving tide of ink-black oil. The person picks up a handful of 'sand' and watches the millions of tiny second hands spin frantically. The sound is a deafening, overwhelming ticking. Visual metaphor for time and mortality, Dali-esque.
