(Fantasy/Action) An Orc chieftain stands on a frozen lake, surrounded by enemy soldiers. He slams his colossal warhammer into the ice. An ultra-slow-motion, low-angle shot shows the ice not just cracking, but shattering upwards into thousands of razor-sharp shards, which he sends flying at his enemies in a deadly wave with a powerful battle roar. Brutal, epic, visceral action.
