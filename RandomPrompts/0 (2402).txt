(Surreal/Comedy) A man in a waiting room sneezes. His head flies off his shoulders like a champagne cork, bounces off the ceiling, and lands perfectly back on his neck. He adjusts his tie nonchalantly. The other people in the waiting room, who all have similarly detachable heads, give him a polite, unimpressed golf clap. Absurdist, physical comedy.
