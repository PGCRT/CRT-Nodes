A young woman with long brown hair and fair skin is kneeling on the ground, holding a small black and tan dog on a leash. She is wearing a short denim dress and black high-heeled sandals. The dog is small and has a black collar. The background is blurred, but it appears to be an outdoor setting with people walking and sitting in the background. The woman's expression is neutral, and she seems to be enjoying the moment.
