Cinematic wide shot of Captain Eva Rostova, a veteran star-freighter captain in her 50s with a stern face and graying hair, standing on the bridge of her silent, derelict ship, the 'Star Wanderer,' which floats dead in a nebula of stunning purple and gold. Her expression is grim as she looks at the non-functional navigation console. | She moves to the ship's mess hall, the only area with emergency power, and finds the ship’s botanist, a young woman, tending to a single, strange, crystalline flower they picked up on a forbidden moon, which is now pulsing with a soft, rhythmic light. Eva's expression is one of deep suspicion. | As Eva reaches out to touch the alien flower, it flashes brilliantly, and the entire ship groans as its systems roar back to life; the navigation console now displays a single, terrifying destination deep in uncharted, hostile territory, and Eva realizes the flower isn't just a plant—it's a parasitic pilot that has just hijacked her ship.
