POV shot from Maya's head-mounted camera as she nervously walks down the long, peeling corridor of a derelict asylum, her flashlight beam cutting through the darkness and revealing rows of rusted bed frames. | She enters a solitary confinement cell and finds a small, leather-bound diary on the floor; she picks it up and begins reading the frantic, looping scrawl of the last patient. | Her breathing becomes ragged as she reads the final, terrifying entry aloud for her camera: "The doctor said the scratching in the walls was just my imagination. But the scratching isn't in the walls anymore. It's inside me." The camera suddenly whips around as a loud scratching sound comes from directly behind her in the empty cell.
