Medium shot of a woman in her late 20s with shoulder-length auburn curls, wearing a soaked emerald green coat, standing in a narrow alley under a flickering streetlamp—rain patters on cobblestones, and neon signs reflect in shallow puddles. Camera slowly pushes in as she clutches a small, tarnished pocket watch, her thumb brushing over its cracked glass face—her lips part slightly, breath catching as she snaps it open to reveal a frozen time. Close-up on her eyes as they shimmer with unshed tears, the rain streaking across her face like a mirror of her grief—the alley fades into a soft bokeh of red and blue lights, suspending her in a moment of poignant stillness.
