A young woman with long blonde hair walking past a graffiti-covered wall in an urban setting. She is wearing a long, grey coat and black pants, and has a black bag slung over her shoulder. The wall is covered in various colorful graffiti, including red, white, and blue. The woman is facing away from the viewer, and her expression is neutral. The image has a high-quality, cinematic feel.
