A tracking shot follows a young woman, Elara, the last "memory-keeper" of her tribe, as she walks through a vast, cavernous library where memories are stored as swirling, colored liquids in glass vials. She runs her fingers over the dusty vials, her expression somber. | She finds a section of the library that is cordoned off and covered in warning runes. She finds a single, unlabeled vial pulsing with a sickly, black light. Driven by a need to understand her people's fall, she uncorks it. | She inhales the vapor, and is instantly assaulted by a visionâ€”not of her people, but of herself, centuries in the future, creating the very plague that destroyed them. She screams as she realizes she is not a preserver of the past, but the architect of her own people's doom.
