A photograph of a woman with fair skin and dark hair styled in a bun, wearing a maroon jacket with a patterned design. She is facing away from the camera, with her eyes closed and a serene expression. The background is blurred, but it appears to be an outdoor setting with a blue and white color scheme. The lighting is soft and natural, casting gentle shadows on her face and upper body. The image has a high-quality, professional feel.
