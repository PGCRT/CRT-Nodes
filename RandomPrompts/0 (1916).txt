A graceful woman with long, wavy auburn hair flowing freely in soft waves, wearing a sheer, emerald-green dress with silver embroidery that accentuates her curvy figure, her olive skin glowing under warm, gaslit lanterns, arranging a bouquet of roses | sidestepping a passing servant in a bustling Victorian manor with a blurred background of polished oak panels, gilded portraits, and open windows, her serene green eyes sparkling with focus, a delicate pearl choker resting against her collarbone, the air filled with the scent of fresh flowers and polished wood, her elegant movements exuding poise, the scene alive with the rustle of silk, the clink of crystal, and the distant hum of a piano, creating a candid, photorealistic Victorian video that captures her refined charm and the opulent, romantic atmosphere of a 19th-century estate at dusk.
