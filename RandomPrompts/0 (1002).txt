Medium shot of a woman in her late 20s with long, honey-blonde hair, wearing a quilted green jacket, standing on a frozen riverbank at twilight—bare willows reflect in the ice, and a lavender sky casts a cool glow. Camera slowly arcs around her as she kneels to brush snow from a small, carved wooden box—her breath clouds, eyes flickering with anticipation. Close-up on her face as she opens the box to reveal a tiny glass star, a tear catching the twilight’s glow—the riverbank blurs into a serene wash of blue and white, suspending her in a moment of quiet wonder.
