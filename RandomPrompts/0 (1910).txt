Wide shot, Kaelen, a hardened scavenger in her mid-20s with a tattooed shaved head, moves with practiced silence through the skeletal remains of a rain-slicked, abandoned metropolis, clutching a scrap spear, her eyes constantly scanning the debris-choked streets. | She freezes, her head tilting at a wet, clicking sound that echoes from a nearby alleyâ€”a sound no human would make; with practiced speed, she kicks a loose pipe, sending a cascade of empty cans clattering down the street as a diversion while she melts into the shadows of a ruined storefront. | From her hiding spot, a low-angle close-up on her terrified face as a grotesque, multi-limbed bio-mechanical horror, dripping viscous fluid, crawls past her position, drawn by the sound of the cans, its metallic claws screeching on the wet pavement just inches from her face.
