A youthful woman with shoulder-length, wavy auburn hair shimmering with a surreal, prismatic glow, wearing a delicate, translucent gown with iridescent crystal threads that highlight her perky breasts and slim physique, her fair skin radiant with a dreamlike, opalescent sheen under shifting, kaleidoscopic light, standing in a surreal dreamscape with a blurred background of floating clocks, melting landscapes, and vibrant, swirling colors, her expressive violet eyes gazing softly at the viewer, lips parted in a wistful expression, a faint glow emanating from her skin, the scene alive with the hum of unseen energy, the scent of sweet, otherworldly blossoms, and a soft breeze carrying whispers of forgotten dreams, creating a photorealistic surreal portrait of ethereal charm and fantastical wonder in a vibrant, disorienting setting.
