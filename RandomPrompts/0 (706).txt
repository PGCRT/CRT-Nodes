A photograph of two young women, one with light skin and blonde hair tied in a high ponytail, and the other with dark hair and a pearl necklace. The woman on the left is wearing a dark blue sweater and has her eyes closed, while the woman on on the right is hugging her neck. Both women have closed eyes and are wearing pearl earrings. The background is blurry and out of focus. The image has a soft, dreamy quality.
