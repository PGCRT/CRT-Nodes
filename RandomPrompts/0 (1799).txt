(Horror) A man is looking in his bathroom mirror. His reflection is lagging a half-second behind his movements. He raises his hand, the reflection raises its hand a moment later. He smiles, the reflection smiles. He stops moving, but the reflection slowly continues to smile, its grin widening impossibly, unnaturally, until it's a silent scream. Uncanny valley horror, single location, rising dread.
