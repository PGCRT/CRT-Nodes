25. Photorealistic image set in a Post-Apocalyptic wasteland, evoking a mood of desperate hope and gritty survival. The subject is a survivor with a lean and wiry body, rough weathered skin spattered with dirt, ash brown hair in a messy bun, and no makeup with a crooked nose. The artistic style is inspired by Mad Maxâ€™s oversaturated aesthetic, with a palette of orange and teal. Shot on RED V-Raptor with a wide-angle 18mm lens, featuring heavy vignetting and chromatic aberration. Ground-level shot, static, framing the survivor scavenging in a ruined city, their expression determined with a clenched jaw.
