(Sci-Fi/Action) A pilot in a sleek fighter jet is engaged in a dogfight. She ejects. But instead of a parachute, a sophisticated, Iron Man-style suit of powered armor assembles around her in mid-air, allowing her to continue the fight on foot the moment she lands. A seamless, high-tech transformation sequence.
