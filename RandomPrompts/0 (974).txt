Two women standing on a street, one in a red coat and the other in a black coat and blue scarf. The woman in the red coat is holding a brown bag and appears to be looking at the other woman, who is standing in front of her. Both women have long blonde hair and are wearing black boots. The background shows a white van parked on the side of the street and a building with a glass door. The image is in black and white and has a watermark in the bottom right corner.
