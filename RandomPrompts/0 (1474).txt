A medium shot of a woman named "Echo," a sound-thief, in a crowded concert hall. She holds up a strange, crystal device. | The lead singer hits a perfect, impossibly high note. Echo's device hums, capturing the pure sound wave in the crystal. | Later, in a secure vault, she holds the glowing crystal up to a voice-locked door. She taps the crystal, and it releases the perfect, high note, shattering the lock and granting her access.
