A medium shot shows a grizzled, world-weary woman named Zora, the last "Lighthouse Keeper" on a rock at the edge of a flat world, polishing the massive, magical lens that holds back the "things from the void." | A massive, tentacled creature made of shadow and starlight begins to rise from the abyss beyond the waterfall-like edge of the world, its psychic pressure causing the very rock of the lighthouse to groan. | Instead of panicking, Zora sighs, puts down her polishing cloth, and pulls a heavy, worn rocking chair to the edge of the platform. She sits down, pours herself a cup of tea, and says to the cosmic horror, "Took you long enough. I was getting bored."
