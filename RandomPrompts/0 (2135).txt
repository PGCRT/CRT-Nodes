(Horror) A POV shot from someone hiding in a cornfield. The stalks rustle violently. Through the gaps, they see glimpses of something enormous and chitinous moving parallel to them, far too fast to be natural. The sound is of a million insects skittering at once. The person starts to run, and the camera becomes a blur of panicked motion as the skittering sound closes in from all sides. High tension, claustrophobic, suggestive horror.
