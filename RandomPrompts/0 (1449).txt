(Sci-Fi/Wonder) A young girl in a simple dress stands in a wheat field at dusk. She holds up a glowing, ethereal jellyfish which floats out of her hands and into the sky. A sweeping drone shot follows the jellyfish as it joins a massive migration of thousands of other bioluminescent sky-jellyfish, turning the twilight sky into a silent, pulsing, otherworldly ocean. Ghibli-esque animation style brought to photorealism, magical, gentle, and breathtaking.
