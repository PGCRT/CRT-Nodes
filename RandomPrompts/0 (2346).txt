(Fantasy/Horror) An adventurer pries open an ancient sarcophagus. It is filled to the brim with sand. He sighs in disappointment and turns to leave. As he walks away, a hand, then an arm, made of solid, animated sand rises from the sarcophagus behind him, reaching for him. The mummy is the sand itself.
