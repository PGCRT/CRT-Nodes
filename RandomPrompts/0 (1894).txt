(Sci-Fi/Genesis) A fast-paced montage of impossible creation. A robotic arm injects a single drop of black liquid into a globe of sterile water. | Tendrils of chrome and circuitry instantly bloom outwards, forming a complex planetary system in miniature. The camera flies through the forming mechanical continents and wire-frame oceans. | The final shot is an extreme close-up of the newly formed Earth, which is a perfect, intricate clockwork sphere. A single green leaf sprouts from a metallic continent. Epic, powerful, birth of a mechanical world.
