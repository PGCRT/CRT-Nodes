A photograph of a young Asian woman with long, wavy red hair and glasses, wearing a black fishnet top and a blue top. She is standing in the middle of the image, looking to the side with a thoughtful expression. The background is blurred, but it appears to be a busy city street with people walking and standing. The woman has a slender physique and fair skin. The image is framed with a black border.
