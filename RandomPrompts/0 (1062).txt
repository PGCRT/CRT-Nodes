(Psychological Horror) A man wakes up in his bed. He performs his morning routineâ€”brushing teeth, making coffee. The camera follows him in a single, unbroken take. He walks to his front door and opens it, revealing the exact same bedroom he just left. He closes the door, turns around, and his entire apartment is now filled with hundreds of identical, silently staring versions of himself. Seamless loop, surreal dread, Kubrick-style cinematography.
