(Awe/Finale) An old man stands on a grassy hill at night, looking at the moon. He holds up a simple wooden flute. He begins to play a soft, melancholic tune. | As he plays, the moon begins to fracture. Huge, continent-sized pieces of it break off silently. | The pieces don't fall. Instead, they gracefully rearrange themselves in the night sky, transforming from a moon into a colossal, luminous, space-faring dragon that blinks its crater-like eye at the old man before majestically swimming away into the sea of stars. Breathtaking, mythic, world-altering event.
