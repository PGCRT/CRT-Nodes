Cinematic medium shot, Dr. Aris Thorne, a sharp academic in her late 30s with glasses, works late at a massive oak desk, the only pool of light in a cavernous, shadowed library; she carefully turns the brittle page of an enormous medieval codex, her expression one of deep, scholarly concentration. | Extreme close-up on her gloved fingers discovering a subtle incision in the thick parchment, she uses a pair of tweezers to pull free a folded, whisper-thin vellum star chart hidden within the page, its constellations ancient and unfamiliar. | Rack focus from the star chart to her face, her eyes wide with terror as she overlays the chart with a modern astronomical projection on her laptop; the alien constellations align perfectly to map a trajectory for a colossal object currently hurtling towards Earth, and a silent, horrified gasp escapes her lips.
