A photograph of a woman with long curly hair, wearing a white long-sleeved shirt and a beige skirt, bending over a blue and white bus stop. She is wearing blue high heels and has a black bag slung over her shoulder. The bus stop has a sign that reads "DINNER AND A DINNER" and "STAND PIPE" on the side. The woman's legs are slightly bent, revealing her toned legs. The photo has a watermark in the bottom right corner.
