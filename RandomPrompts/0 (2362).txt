Two women walking down a street, both wearing face masks and holding disposable cups with straws. The woman on the left has long brown hair and is wearing a gray hoodie and blue jeans. She is holding a small white box with a straw in her right hand and is looking at the other woman with a surprised expression. The background shows a busy street with cars and people walking. The image is slightly blurred, giving it a dreamy quality.
