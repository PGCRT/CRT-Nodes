Cinematic shot from above, showing Dr. Kenna Alistair, a fiercely independent volcanologist, descending via winch from a helicopter into the smoking, active caldera of a massive volcano. The heat haze distorts the air around her as she wears a silver heat-suit. | She lands on a newly formed obsidian ledge near the lava lake and begins taking geological samples, her movements precise and scientific. She notices her instruments are picking up a rhythmic, structured, magnetic pulse from beneath the lavaâ€”a pattern that cannot be natural. | The surface of the lava in front of her begins to bubble and bulge upwards. Not with a gas eruption, but as something colossal and solid pushes its way up from below. A massive, metallic, rune-etched hand, the size of a bus, breaks the surface of the molten rock, reaching slowly and deliberately towards her.
