(Fantasy) A dwarven blacksmith hammers a piece of glowing meteorite on an anvil. With each strike, the camera crash-zooms in and out, and sparks fly off not as fire, but as tiny, fleeting galaxies and stars that fade into the dusty workshop air. The final hammer blow cracks the meteorite, revealing a beating heart of pure, solidified light inside. High-contrast, warm lighting, epic fantasy crafting.
