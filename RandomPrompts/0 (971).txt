In a city where it always rains, a woman runs a small, hidden shop that sells umbrellas. | A man with eyes full of sorrow enters. She doesn't sell him an umbrella. | She hands him a small, clay pot with a single seed in it and says, "Some things are not meant to be sheltered. They are meant to be watered so they can grow."
