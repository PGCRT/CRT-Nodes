A photograph of a woman and a man walking across a parking lot at sunset. The woman, with long red hair and fair skin, is wearing a black tank top and brown shorts, and is carrying a black crossbody bag. The man, with short brown hair and a blue shirt and gray pants, is walking ahead of her. The lighting is warm and casts shadows on the ground. The parking lot has white lines and a yellow stripe on the left side. The image is taken from a low angle, looking up at the couple.
