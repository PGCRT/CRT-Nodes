A young woman with fair skin and dark hair, sitting on a stone ledge in Prague, Czech Republic. She is wearing a dark blue coat, a light green scarf, and black pants. She has a relaxed expression and is looking directly at the camera. The background features a bustling cityscape with buildings and a green dome-shaped building. The sky is clear and blue. The image has a watermark in the bottom right corner.
