17. Cinematic image set in the 1950s Atomic Age, conveying a mood of optimistic futurism and subtle paranoia. The subject is a scientist with a lean and wiry body, pale ivory skin with faint scars, jet black hair in a pompadour, and no makeup with a cleft chin. The artistic style is inspired by Technicolor musical, with a saturated jewel-toned palette. Shot on Panavision Panaflex GII with a Panavision C-Series Anamorphic 50mm lens, featuring anamorphic lens flares and dreamy bokeh. Eye-level medium shot, static, capturing the scientist in a lab, examining a glowing reactor, their expression intrigued with a raised eyebrow.
