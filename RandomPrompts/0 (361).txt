(Historical/Action) A samurai warrior in full armor stands perfectly still in a tranquil bamboo forest, snow gently falling. A water droplet falls from a leaf onto his katana's guard. An extreme slow-motion, macro shot follows the droplet. As it shatters, the samurai explodes into motion, a whirlwind of steel and fury, cutting down five hidden assassins in a single, fluid sequence. The camera follows the blade in a seamless, impossible arc. Kurosawa-inspired, high-contrast black and white with the red of blood being the only color.
