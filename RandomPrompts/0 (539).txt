(Thriller) A woman is home alone during a storm. The power goes out. She lights a candle. The flash of a lightning strike illuminates the room, and in the split-second of bright light, she sees that every piece of furniture in the room has been replaced with an exact replica made of glistening, dark ice. The room is plunged back into darkness. Atmospheric, high-concept horror.
