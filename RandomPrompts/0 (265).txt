Medium shot of a woman in her late 20s with long, dark brown hair, wearing a moss-green shawl, standing at the edge of a forested cliff at sunrise—mist rises from the valley below, and golden light filters through pines. Camera slowly pushes in as she opens a small, wooden box, revealing a single pressed flower—her face softens, eyes glistening with memory. Close-up on her profile as she holds the flower, a tear catching the sunlight—the cliff blurs into a radiant haze of green and gold, suspending her in a moment of tender reverence.
