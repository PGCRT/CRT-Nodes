Two women standing side by side on a busy street, both wearing sunglasses. The woman on the left has long brown hair and is wearing a black scarf around her neck. She is holding a small device in her left hand and appears to be looking directly at the camera with a neutral expression. The other woman, with long dark hair and a slender build, is wearing an unknown outfit and holding a piece of paper in her right hand. The background is blurred, with other people and buildings visible. The image is framed with a black border at the top and bottom.
