Medium shot of Clara, a shy young librarian, carefully re-shelving books in a quiet, sunlit library; she notices a single, plain, leather-bound book with no title or markings that she has never seen before. | She takes the strange book to a table, a curious frown on her face, and opens it to the first page, which is completely blank. | Extreme close-up on the blank page as she thinks, "I wonder what this is?"; shimmering, golden ink magically appears on the page, writing the exact words "I wonder what this is?" and she slams the book shut with a gasp, her eyes wide with disbelief and fright.
