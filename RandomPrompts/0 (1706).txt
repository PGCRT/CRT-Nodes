A photograph of two young women standing side by side, both with fair skin and long brown hair. The woman on the left is wearing a light pink tank top and blue jeans, with a black wristwatch and a black bag slung over her shoulder. She has a slender physique and is looking to the side with a smile. The man on the right is also wearing a white sleeveless top and black shorts with a fanny belt. The background features a metal fence with a poster that reads "Festival International Jazz". The lighting is soft and diffused, creating a moody atmosphere.
