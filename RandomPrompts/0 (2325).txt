A woman with long braided hair wearing a black dress, standing on a city street next to a parked car. She is holding a bottle of sunscreen in her hand and has a bag slung over her shoulder. The street is lined with parked cars and pedestrians, and there are buildings and trees in the background. The image is slightly blurred, giving it a dreamy quality.
