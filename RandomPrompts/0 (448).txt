A radiant woman with long, cascading auburn hair flowing in glossy, voluminous curls past her waist, wearing a sheer, sapphire-blue dress with intricate silver embroidery that clings to her curvy figure, accentuating her full, natural breasts and toned hips, her smooth, porcelain skin shimmering with a dewy glow under soft, golden-hour sunlight filtering through wispy clouds, standing gracefully on a windswept meadow with a blurred background of rolling green hills and distant wildflowers swaying gently in the breeze, her piercing green eyes sparkling with serene intensity, lips parted in a subtle smile, a delicate gold necklace resting against her collarbone, exuding timeless elegance and tranquility in a vibrant, photorealistic pastoral scene, the air filled with the faint scent of lavender and the distant hum of nature.
