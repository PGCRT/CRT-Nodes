Medium shot of a woman in her late 20s with long, blonde hair in a loose braid, wearing a sage-green shawl, standing on an overgrown garden path at sunrise—wildflowers tangle around her, and golden light filters through ancient oaks. Camera slowly tracks forward as she kneels to pick up a small, tarnished key buried in the dirt—her face stills, a faint smile breaking through her sorrow. Close-up on her eyes as they shimmer with unshed tears, the sunlight catching her lashes—the path blurs into a dreamy haze of green and gold, framing her in a moment of tender discovery.
