A woman with long black hair wearing a black leather jacket and tight blue jeans, standing in the middle of a cobblestone street. She is wearing black high-heeled boots and has a black crossbody bag slung over her shoulder. The street is bustling with people, some sitting and some standing, and there are buildings with arched windows in the background. The image is slightly blurred, with a watermark in the bottom right corner.
