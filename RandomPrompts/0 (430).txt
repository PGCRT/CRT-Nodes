In the image, a woman is lying on her stomach on a sandy beach with her legs partially submerged in the water. She has wet hair and appears to be wearing a light-colored, unbuttoned garment that seems to be dripping with moisture from the sea. The background features a body of water with waves crashing onto the shore, suggesting an oceanic setting. There are large rocks visible near the water's edge, adding to the rugged beach environment. The lighting suggests it might be early morning or late afternoon due to the soft glow on the scene.
