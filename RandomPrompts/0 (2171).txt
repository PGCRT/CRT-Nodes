(Fantasy) A slow, orbiting shot of a "Chronomancer"—a mage who manipulates time—repairing a broken vase. He gestures, and the shattered pieces on the floor levitate and reverse their trajectory, flying back together in a beautiful, slow-motion ballet until the vase is whole again on its pedestal. Visually satisfying, magical.
