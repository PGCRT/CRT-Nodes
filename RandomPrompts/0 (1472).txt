Medium shot of a woman in her late 20s with short, ash-blonde hair, wearing a worn corduroy jacket, standing inside a crumbling clock tower at dusk—rusted gears loom in the shadows, and faint light streams through a cracked circular window. Camera slowly tracks in as she pulls a small, tarnished pocket watch from her pocket, her fingers brushing over its etched initials—her expression shifts from curious to pensive, the wind stirring dust around her. Close-up on her face as she opens the watch, its faint ticking echoing softly, a tear catching the golden twilight—the tower blurs into a hazy mix of amber and gray, isolating her in a moment of quiet reflection.
