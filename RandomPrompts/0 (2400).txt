Medium shot of a woman in her late 20s with tousled brunette hair, wearing a patched denim jacket, standing in the center of an abandoned carnival at twilight—rusted rides loom in the distance, and fairy lights flicker faintly against a lavender sky. Camera slowly pushes in as she picks up a faded carnival ticket from the ground, her fingers tracing its worn edges—her brow furrows, a flicker of nostalgia crossing her face. Close-up on her profile as a breeze lifts her hair, a single tear catching the fading light—the carousel behind her blurs into a soft whirl of colors, suspending her in a bittersweet memory.
