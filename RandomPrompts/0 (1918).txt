A photograph of two young women standing on a busy street, holding hands. The woman on the left is wearing a red dress and has long brown hair tied in a ponytail. She is also wearing a black leather backpack. The man on the right is wearing denim shorts and a gray sleeveless t-shirt. They are facing away from the camera, with the man's hand resting on the woman's thigh. The background shows a bustling cityscape with tall buildings and a red double-decker bus. The image has a green border and a watermark in the bottom right corner.
