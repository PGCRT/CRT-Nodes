Medium shot of a woman in her early 30s with shoulder-length platinum hair, wearing a heavy charcoal coat, standing outside a snow-covered mountain cabin at twilight—pine trees cast long shadows, and a soft lavender sky glows faintly. Camera slowly arcs around her as she pulls a small, engraved compass from her pocket, her fingers tracing its worn surface—her expression hardens, eyes glistening with quiet resolve. Close-up on her face as she opens the compass, its needle spinning erratically, a tear freezing on her cheek—the snowy landscape blurs into a serene wash of white and violet, isolating her in a moment of steadfast determination.
