A photograph of a young woman standing in a dimly lit room, wearing a white sleeveless top and dark pants. She is holding a small, yellow bag in her left hand and a smartphone in her right hand. The room has a glass door with the words "Goorin Bros." written on it. The woman has long, dark hair and is looking directly at the camera with a serious expression. The lighting is soft and warm, casting shadows on her body. The background is dark, with a few items visible inside the glass door. The image has a high-quality, professional feel.
