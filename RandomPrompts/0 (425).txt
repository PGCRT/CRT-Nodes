(Surreal/Romance) A man and a woman stand on opposite sides of a busy street, making eye contact. As their connection deepens, the chaotic traffic between them—cars, trucks, buses—fades into ghostly, transparent outlines, leaving a clear, silent path between them, as if their focus erases the rest of the world. Romantic, magical realism.
