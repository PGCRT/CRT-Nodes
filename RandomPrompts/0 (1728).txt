(Thriller) A woman is in a crowded subway car. She feels her phone vibrate. She pulls it out. The message is from an unknown number and contains only a photo. The photo is of her, in the same subway car, taken from over her shoulder just a second ago. A slow, paranoid pan around the faces of the other passengers, any one of whom could be the sender. Modern anxiety, claustrophobic.
