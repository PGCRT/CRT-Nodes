(Sci-Fi/Peaceful) A robot gardener tends to a zero-gravity greenhouse aboard a space station. It moves with balletic grace, watering floating spheres of soil from which beautiful, alien flowers grow. Sunlight streams through the viewport, illuminating the gentle, silent dance of technology and life. Serene, beautiful, utopian.
