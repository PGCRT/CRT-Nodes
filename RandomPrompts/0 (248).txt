A woman standing in a dimly lit subway station, holding a colorful plaid blanket. She has long black hair and is wearing a blue puffer coat. The background shows a metal elevator with a red and white sign. The image is taken from a low angle, looking up at the woman. The lighting is dramatic, casting shadows on the walls. The woman has a serious expression on her face.
