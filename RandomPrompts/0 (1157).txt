Medium shot of a woman in her late 20s with short, dark blonde hair, wearing a faded green sweater, standing among coastal tide pools at sunset—waves lap gently, and the sky burns with hues of orange and pink. Camera slowly tracks forward as she kneels to pick up a small, polished seashell—her face softens, a flicker of nostalgia crossing her eyes. Close-up on her profile as she holds the shell to her ear, a tear catching the sunset’s glow—the tide pools blur into a warm wash of gold and blue, isolating her in a moment of tender memory.
