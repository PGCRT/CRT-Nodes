Wide atmospheric shot of Lyra Swiftbow, an elven ranger, moving silently through a twisted, unnaturally silent forest where the trees weep black sap and the ground is covered in grey, dying moss. | Close-up as she kneels, touching not a footprint, but a patch of grass that has turned to black, brittle crystal; a look of profound sadness crosses her face as she identifies the magical corruption. | She rises, her expression hardening with resolve, and from a special quiver she draws a single, glass-tipped arrow filled with shimmering, silver dust; she nocks the arrow, her eyes fixed on the clearing ahead where a magnificent unicorn, its coat matted and its horn glowing with a sickly purple light, now stands, tragically corrupted.
