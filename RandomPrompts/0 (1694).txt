A woman standing on a wet pavement, holding an oversized pink and black umbrella with a floral design. She is wearing a long black dress, a red scarf, and black high heels. She has a silver tote bag slung over her shoulder. The background shows a yellow building with balconies and a parking lot with parked cars. The sky is overcast and the ground is puddling with water. The image is framed with a black border.
