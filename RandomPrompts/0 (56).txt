(Steampunk/Adventure) A hot air balloon airship floats not through the sky, but through a vast, cavernous underground world, lit by giant phosphorescent crystals. A low-angle shot from the ship's deck shows colossal, ancient cave paintings of unknown creatures on the cavern ceiling thousands of feet above. Journey to the Center of the Earth-style wonder.
