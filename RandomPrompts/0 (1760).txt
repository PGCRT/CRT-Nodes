Medium shot of a woman in her early 30s with long, raven hair tied loosely, wearing a thick fisherman’s sweater, standing on a fog-shrouded harbor dock at dawn—moored boats sway gently, their masts vanishing into the mist. Camera dollies in as she kneels beside a weathered rope, retrieving a small glass bottle with a rolled note inside—her breath catches, eyes softening with recognition as she uncorks it. Close-up on her eyes as she reads the note, a tear tracing her cheek, reflecting the pale harbor light—the fog and water blur into a soft veil of gray and blue, framing her in a moment of tender discovery.
