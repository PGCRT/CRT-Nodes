In a grand, steampunk-Victorian ballroom, where clockwork automatons serve champagne, Lady Ada, a brilliant but rebellious inventor, dances with a rival industrialist. She wears an elegant gown, but hidden within its folds are various tools and gadgets. Her smile is a sharp, calculated mask. | Her partner leans in and whispers a threat about a hostile takeover of her family's company. As he does, she deftly uses a small, custom-made device hidden in her palm to lift his unique, golden keycard from his waistcoat pocket without him noticing. | She excuses herself and proceeds to the industrialist's private study. She uses the keycard to open his massive, brass-and-steel safe, expecting to find corporate documents. Instead, she finds blueprints for a terrifying, city-leveling "aetheric bomb," along with a map, and her own family's insignia is marked as the first target.
