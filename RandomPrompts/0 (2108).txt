Two women sitting on a wooden bench near a marina, one wearing a black headscarf and the other wearing a blue denim jacket and jeans. The woman on the left is holding a small fish in her hand, while the other woman is looking at her phone. Both women have short, red hair and are wearing sunglasses. The background shows several boats docked in the marina and a lifebuoy. The image is slightly blurred, with a watermark in the bottom left corner.
