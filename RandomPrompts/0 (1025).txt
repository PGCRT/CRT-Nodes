Medium shot of a woman in her late 20s with wavy, chestnut hair, wearing a heavy gray coat, standing on a snowy mountain path at dawn—pine trees loom, and a soft pink sky casts a gentle glow. Camera slowly tracks forward as she kneels to brush snow from a small, carved stone—her breath clouds, eyes softening with recognition. Close-up on her eyes as they shimmer with tears, the sunrise catching her lashes—the path blurs into a serene haze of white and pink, isolating her in a moment of quiet discovery.
