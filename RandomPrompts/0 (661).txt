(Surreal) A man in a business suit stands on a beach, holding a briefcase. He opens it. Instead of papers, a flock of black birds flies out, soaring into the stormy sky. He closes the empty briefcase and calmly walks into the raging ocean, disappearing beneath the waves. The camera holds on the empty beach as one black feather drifts down and lands on the sand. Magritte-inspired, melancholic, symbolic.
