The image shows two young women with long blonde hair, wearing sunglasses and a white t-shirt with the text "The best is yet to come" printed on it, and ripped blue jeans. They are standing in a line on a busy street, surrounded by other people, some of whom are wearing casual clothing. One woman is holding a blue bag, while the other is wearing a beige cardigan and a pair of sunglasses. The background shows a busy city street with buildings and a red signboard. The image is slightly blurred, but it appears to be taken during the day.
