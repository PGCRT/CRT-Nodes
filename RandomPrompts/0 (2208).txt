A young woman with long blonde hair standing in the rain, holding a large, transparent umbrella with a blue handle. She is wearing a black coat and has a tattoo on her right arm. The background is blurred, but it appears to be an outdoor setting with other people in the background. The woman is looking to the side with a calm expression.
