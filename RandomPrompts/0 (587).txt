In a dystopian city where all citizens are tracked by retinal scanners, a data-thief named Nyx gets a black market eye transplant. Her new eye is a brilliant, unnatural shade of violet. | She looks into the first scanner she sees, expecting to be flagged. | Instead, the entire city-wide surveillance network crashes, and a single message appears on every screen: "SYSTEM OVERRIDE. WELCOME, ADMINISTRATOR."
