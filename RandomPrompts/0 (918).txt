(Surreal/Horror) A child is drawing with chalk on a playground. They draw a hopscotch grid. When they toss the stone, it doesn't land on a number; it vanishes as it hits the pavement. The child looks closer and sees the squares are not drawings, but actual, perfectly square holes cut into the fabric of reality, looking down into a silent, starry void. Cosmic horror in a mundane setting.
