A radiant woman with long, cascading raven-black hair flowing in glossy, voluminous waves past her waist, wearing a sheer, emerald-green gown with delicate gold embroidery that clings to her curvy figure, accentuating her full, natural breasts and toned hips, her smooth, porcelain skin shimmering with a dewy glow under soft, golden-hour sunlight filtering through a canopy of ancient oaks, standing gracefully in a secluded forest clearing with a blurred background of lush greenery, moss-covered stones, and a distant babbling brook, her piercing blue eyes sparkling with serene intensity, lips parted in a gentle smile, a delicate silver pendant with an emerald gem resting against her collarbone, the air filled with the earthy scent of damp moss and the faint rustle of leaves, her poised stance exuding timeless elegance, creating a breathtaking, photorealistic woodland portrait that captures her ethereal beauty and the tranquil atmosphere of the serene forest at dusk.
