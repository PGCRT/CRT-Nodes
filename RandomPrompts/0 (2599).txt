A radiant woman with long, flowing lavender hair glowing with a soft, ethereal sheen, wearing a sheer, silver-threaded robe with starlight embroidery that highlights her slender frame, her luminous, fair skin glowing under the soft light of floating lanterns, weaving a glowing thread | dodging a sudden burst of arcane sparks in a celestial temple with a blurred background of crystalline pillars, glowing constellations, and swirling mist, her serene violet eyes focused on her ritual, a delicate moonstone pendant catching the light, the air filled with the scent of incense and stardust, her graceful movements exuding enchantment, the scene alive with the hum of cosmic energy, the chime of crystals, and distant pulsar beats, creating a candid, photorealistic celestial fantasy video that captures her mystical allure and the serene, otherworldly atmosphere of a starlit sanctuary at midnight.
