Medium shot of a woman in her early 30s with shoulder-length blonde hair, wearing a black velvet dress, standing on the stage of an abandoned music hall—tattered curtains hang loosely, and a single spotlight casts a soft glow. Camera slowly pushes in as she kneels to pick up a dusty sheet of music, her fingers tracing the faded notes—her expression shifts from curious to haunted. Close-up on her eyes as they glisten with tears, the spotlight haloing her face—the hall fades into a warm blur of crimson and gold, framing her in a moment of quiet revelation.
