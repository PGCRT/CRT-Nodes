A photograph of a woman and a man walking together on a street. The woman is wearing a colorful, patterned outfit with orange and white flowers, while the man is dressed in a black, diamond-patterned jacket and black pants. She is holding a red bag in her hand. The man is taking a photo of the woman. The background is blurred, but it appears to be an outdoor setting with trees and buildings. The image is taken from a low angle, looking up at the woman and the man.
