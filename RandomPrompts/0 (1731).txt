Two women standing next to each other in a snowy outdoor setting. The woman on the left is wearing a black beanie, a blue scarf, and a black coat. She is holding a knife in her right hand and appears to be taking a photo of the other woman, who is standing on the right side of the image. Both women have long blonde hair and are wearing winter clothes. The background shows a stone building with a metal gate and a snow-covered ground. The image is high quality and has a watermark in the bottom right corner.
