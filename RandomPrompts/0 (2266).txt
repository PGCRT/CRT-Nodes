The image presents a woman standing in the water, her body partially submerged and her upper body exposed. She is wearing a sheer white garment that drapes over her torso, revealing a black bra underneath. Her hair flows freely around her face as she leans slightly to one side with her head tilted upwards towards the sky.

She is gazing into the distance where the sun casts an orange glow across the water's surface, creating a reflection of light on the water. The background shows a vast expanse of water extending into the horizon, which appears calm with subtle ripples. There are no other objects or individuals visible in the scene; it feels secluded and tranquil, emphasizing the solitary nature of the woman's pose against the serene backdrop of the sea.
