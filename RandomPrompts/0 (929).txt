(Historical/Supernatural) Abraham Lincoln sits alone in the Oval Office at night, lit by a fireplace. He looks exhausted. He whispers, "I don't know if I can do this." | A shadowy, translucent hand gently rests on his shoulder. The camera rack focuses to the fireplace, where the faint, ghostly image of George Washington is visible, nodding encouragingly. | Lincoln takes a deep breath, his resolve strengthened, and turns back to the papers on his desk. Somber, supernatural historical fiction, emotionally resonant.
