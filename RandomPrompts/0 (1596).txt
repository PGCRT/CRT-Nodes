A woman standing on a city street, wearing a black quilted jacket with a fur collar, black leggings, and black boots. She is holding a white plastic bag with a red heart-shaped design, and has a black handbag slung over her shoulder. The background shows a blue and white bus parked on the side of the street, a tall building in the distance, and a few trees. The sky is overcast and the image has a watermark in the bottom right corner.
