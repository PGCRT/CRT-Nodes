26. Cinematic image set in a Dieselpunk airbase, conveying a mood of rugged determination and mechanical grit. The subject is a mechanic with a stocky body, rough weathered skin spattered with grease, chestnut brown hair in a pompadour, and no makeup with a cleft chin. The artistic style is inspired by gritty realism, with a high-contrast teal and orange palette. Shot on RED Komodo with a wide-angle 18mm lens, featuring heavy film grain and chromatic aberration. Eye-level medium shot, static, capturing the mechanic repairing an engine, their expression focused with a furrowed brow.
