A slow, atmospheric tracking shot follows Elara, the Royal Cartographer, a pragmatic woman in her 30s dressed in waxed canvas and leather, as she stands at the misty, fog-shrouded edge of the dreaded Whispering Woods. She unrolls a large, blank sheet of vellum on a portable wooden easel, her face a mask of stern professionalism as she consults a series of intricate, brass-and-crystal surveying tools. | She takes a deep breath and steps into the oppressive gloom of the forest, where the trees seem to twist and the paths shift when not directly observed. She attempts to map a gnarled, ancient tree, but her charcoal pencil snaps under the pressure of her frustration, the sharp sound echoing in the unnatural silence as she realizes her conventional methods are failing. | She glances down at the map in exasperation and her blood runs cold. The vellum is no longer blank. A network of impossibly detailed, blood-red lines is bleeding into existence on the page, perfectly mapping the forest around her as if the map itself is alive. The camera pushes in on her horrified face as the final detail draws itself: a circle of standing stones in the center of the map, with a tiny, perfect rendering of a lone figure trapped withinâ€”a figure of herself.
