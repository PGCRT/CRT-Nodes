(Sci-Fi/Sport) A dynamic, high-speed tracking shot follows a player in a sleek, aerodynamic suit during a game of zero-gravity "Aero-Ball." The arena is a transparent sphere orbiting Earth. The player uses bursts from their jetpack to dodge opponents, catching a glowing ball and rocketing towards a goal ring, the blue marble of the planet a stunning backdrop to the intense sport. Tron meets Rocket League, fast-paced, visually spectacular.
