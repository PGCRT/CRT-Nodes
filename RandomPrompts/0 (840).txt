(Action) A frantic, shaky-cam POV shot from inside a riot shield. A police officer is in the middle of a chaotic protest. Bricks, bottles, and debris impact the shield, obscuring the view. Through the scratches and cracks, we see glimpses of the raging crowd, creating a claustrophobic, terrifyingly immersive experience of being on the front line.
