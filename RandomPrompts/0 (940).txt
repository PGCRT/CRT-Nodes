38. Cinematic image set in an Abstract Temporal Flux, conveying a mood of surreal disorientation and quiet wonder. The subject is a time traveler with a gamine body, iridescent skin with a prismatic sheen, rainbow hair in wispy flyaways, and avant-garde makeup with glitter on eyelids. The artistic style is inspired by David Lynch’s surrealism, with a psychedelic palette of acidic colors. Shot on LomoKino with a Lensbaby lens, featuring selective focus and dreamy bokeh. Bird’s-eye view, static, capturing the time traveler standing in a swirling vortex, their expression awestruck with parted lips.
