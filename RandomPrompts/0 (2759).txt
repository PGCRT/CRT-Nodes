Two young women walking down a busy street in a city, both wearing tight, light blue leggings and white sneakers. The woman on the left has long blonde hair, wearing a black and white fur coat, and carrying a large black and pink bag. She is holding a smartphone in her hand, while the other woman is wearing a white quilted jacket and red pants. The street is lined with lampposts and a red post box. The background shows a bustling cityscape with people walking and sitting. The image is framed with a red border and has a watermark in the bottom left corner.
