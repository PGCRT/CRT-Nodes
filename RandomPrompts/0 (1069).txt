A woman with fair skin and dark brown hair walking down a narrow street. She is wearing a bright green and black striped jacket, black leggings, and a black fanny pack. The street is lined with brick walls covered in graffiti, and there are several parked cars and people in the background. The woman is looking to the side with a serious expression. The image is taken from a low angle, looking up at the woman.
