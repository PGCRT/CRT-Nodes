The image captures a woman lying on her stomach on the wet sand of a beach, with her body partially turned towards the camera. She is wearing a blue bikini top and matching bottoms, which are sparkly or sequined, adding a touch of glamour to her appearance. Her hair flows down over her shoulders, catching some light as she lies down. The background shows the ocean's edge where waves have left their marks, and the water appears calm, suggesting it might be early morning or late afternoon when the sun is not too strong. There is no text present in the image.
