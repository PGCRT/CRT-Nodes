10. Photorealistic image set in the Napoleonic Era, evoking a mood of martial pride and quiet sacrifice. The subject is a general with a broad-shouldered and powerful body, rough weathered skin with faint scars, ash brown hair in a short crop, and no makeup with a cleft chin. The artistic style is inspired by Romanticism (Turner), with a high-contrast teal and orange palette. Shot on Panavision Panaflex System 65 with a Cooke S4/i 50mm lens, featuring soft blooming highlights and fine film grain. Low-angle wide shot, static, capturing the general on horseback, surveying a battlefield, their expression resolute with a clenched jaw.
