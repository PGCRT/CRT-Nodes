(Historical/Horror) A group of colonial settlers are huddling in their small, wooden fort at night. They hear strange clicking sounds outside. One peers through a crack in the wall. The POV shot shows not native warriors or animals, but impossibly tall, slender, insectoid creatures, like giant stick bugs, silently peering back at them with compound eyes. Revisionist horror, high tension.
