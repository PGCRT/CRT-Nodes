Medium shot of a woman in her late 20s with short, raven hair, wearing a worn leather jacket, standing beside a derelict carousel on a foggy pier—rusted horses gleam faintly, and waves crash softly in the distance. Camera slowly tracks forward as she reaches into her bag, pulling out a small, tarnished music box shaped like a carousel—her brow furrows, a faint smile breaking through her sorrow. Close-up on her eyes as she winds the box, its delicate melody rising, a tear reflecting the misty light—the carousel blurs into a soft whirl of gray and silver, framing her in a moment of bittersweet nostalgia.
