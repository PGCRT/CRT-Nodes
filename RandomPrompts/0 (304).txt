(Sci-Fi/Horror) A terraforming crew on a new planet watches the first rain begin to fall from an alien sky. They cheer and hold out their hands. A drop lands on one crewman's glove. A close-up shows the 'water' is actually a microscopic, grey, nanite swarm that immediately begins to consume the glove and the flesh beneath, converting it into more of itself. The cheering turns to screams. Grey goo scenario, terrifyingly fast, clinical horror.
