(Sci-Fi) A close-up on a data jack on a person's neck. A cable is plugged in. The camera does a "push-in" transition, flying into the jack. We are now in a vast, abstract, digital mindscape representing the person's consciousnessâ€”a library of memories, an ocean of emotions, a city of logic. A breathtaking visualization of an inner world.
