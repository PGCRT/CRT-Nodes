Medium shot of a woman in her early 30s with sleek, platinum hair, wearing a black wool coat, standing on a snowy rooftop terrace at twilight—city lights glow below, and snowflakes drift gently. Camera slowly arcs around her as she opens a small, silver case, revealing a single pressed violet—her breath clouds, eyes softening with recognition. Close-up on her eyes as they shimmer with tears, the snow catching the twilight’s glow—the city blurs into a serene wash of white and blue, suspending her in a moment of tender memory.
