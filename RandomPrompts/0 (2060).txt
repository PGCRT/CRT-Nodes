Medium shot of a woman in her late 20s with wavy, dark blonde hair, wearing a heavy gray sweater, standing at a mountain lookout at dawn—jagged peaks loom, and a faint mist curls below. Camera slowly tracks forward as she opens a small, leather-bound journal, her fingers brushing over a faded entry—her lips tremble, eyes softening with memory. Close-up on her eyes as they well with tears, reflecting the sunrise—the mountains blur into a serene wash of pink and gray, suspending her in a moment of quiet reflection.
