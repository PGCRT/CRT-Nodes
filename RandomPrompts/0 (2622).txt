(Historical/Epic) A "match cut" sequence. A Roman architect draws a line on a blueprint for the Colosseum. The shot cuts to a stonemason carving that same line into a massive block. Cuts to a slave hauling the block into place. Cuts to the finished Colosseum, packed with spectators. The sequence ends with a modern-day tour guide tracing the same line on the ancient ruin. A story of creation told across millennia in seconds.
