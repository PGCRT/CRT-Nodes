(Action/Spy) A spy needs to cross a room with a floor covered in pressure sensors. He looks up. A dynamic, low-angle shot shows him leaping up, and with incredible gymnastic skill, traversing the ceiling by ricocheting off the hanging light fixtures, never touching the floor. Mission Impossible-style creativity and tension.
