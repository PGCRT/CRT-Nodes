7. Photorealistic image set in Qing Dynasty China, evoking a mood of serene elegance and hidden sorrow. The subject is an empress with a petite and slender body, pale porcelain skin with faint beauty marks, jet black hair in a chignon with ornate pins, and natural makeup with high cheekbones. The artistic style is inspired by watercolor illustration, with a pastel palette. Shot on Canon C500 Mark II with a Leica Summilux-C 50mm lens, featuring creamy bokeh and soft-focus filter. Eye-level medium shot, static, framing the empress seated in a silk-draped pavilion, holding a fan, her expression wistful with a faint frown.
