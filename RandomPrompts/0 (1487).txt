A woman with a slender build and fair skin, wearing a dark purple sleeveless dress and a black helmet, riding a bicycle on a city street. She is wearing glasses and has a green tag around her neck. In the background, there is a brick wall and a few people walking on the sidewalk. A man is kneeling on the ground, holding a small dog. The image has a watermark in the bottom right corner.
