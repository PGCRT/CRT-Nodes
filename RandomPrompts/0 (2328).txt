Cinematic medium shot of Dr. Jian Li, a bio-linguist in a sterile, high-tech containment lab, separated by thick plexiglass from a strange, plant-like alien specimen. The alien, a pulsating, phosphorescent fungus, is beautiful but unsettling. Jian’s face is a picture of intense academic focus as she exposes it to different audio frequencies. | She plays a recording of complex, structured whale songs, and the fungus reacts, its internal light patterns shifting and pulsing in a clear, rhythmic response. A look of triumphant breakthrough washes over her face as she realizes it's not just reacting, it's communicating, mimicking the sonar patterns with its light. | She leans closer to the glass, her smile fading as the fungus’s light patterns become more complex, evolving past the whale song. It begins flashing a new, intricate sequence that translates on her monitor to a terrifyingly coherent message: "IT IS A TRAP. DO NOT LET IT HEAR YOUR VOICE. IT LEARNS."
