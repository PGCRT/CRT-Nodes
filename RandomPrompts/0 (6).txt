In a deep-space archeological vessel, Dr. Imani Adebayo, a xeno-linguist, finally cracks the code of an alien artifactâ€”a smooth, black sphere that has been inert for months. Her face shows a flicker of triumph. | She inputs the final command, and the sphere projects a shimmering, 3D star map into the center of the lab, showing a previously unknown galaxy. The scientific implications are staggering. | The star map then reconfigures, zooming in on their own ship's location. A single, pulsing red dot appears on the map, accompanied by a single, translated alien word projected in the air: "BAIT."
