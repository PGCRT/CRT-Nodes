Medium shot of a woman in her early 30s with windswept black hair, wearing a navy wool coat, standing at the base of a weathered lighthouse on a stormy evening—waves crash against jagged rocks below, and dark clouds swirl above. Camera dollies in as she pulls a folded letter from her coat, her hands trembling as she unfolds it, rain smudging the ink—her lips part, eyes glistening with resolve. Close-up on her face as a gust of wind tears the letter from her hands, her gaze following it into the storm—the lighthouse beam sweeps across her features, and the sea blurs into a turbulent wash of gray and blue, framing her in a moment of fierce surrender.
