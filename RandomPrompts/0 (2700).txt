Medium shot of a woman in her early 30s with short, raven hair, wearing a faded denim coat, standing in a deserted train yard at twilight—rusted carriages loom, and soft light filters through the dust. Camera slowly tracks in as she pulls a small, folded map from her pocket, her fingers tracing a marked route—her lips tremble, eyes softening with memory. Close-up on her profile as a tear rolls down her cheek, catching the twilight’s glow—the yard blurs into a dreamy wash of amber and gray, framing her in a moment of quiet sorrow.
