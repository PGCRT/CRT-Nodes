(Fantasy/War) A trebuchet on a castle wall launches a payload at an attacking army. But instead of a rock, it's a large, caged sphere of pure, compressed sunlight. An aerial shot follows the projectile. It shatters over the enemy ranks, not with an explosion, but with a silent, blinding flash of light that vaporizes the shadows and turns the enemy soldiers to statues of ash. Epic, high-fantasy warfare.
