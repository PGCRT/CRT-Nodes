The woman on the left is wearing a traditional African outfit with a floral pattern, the woman in the middle is holding a brown paper bag, and the woman at the right is wearing an intricate white lace dress with a red headscarf. The background shows a lush green landscape with trees and buildings. The sky is clear and blue. The image has a watermark in the bottom left corner.
