A poised woman with long, wavy platinum blonde hair flowing freely down her back in soft, silken waves, wearing a sheer white dress with intricate pearl beadwork that clings to her voluptuous breasts and slender waist, her flawless, tanned skin illuminated by soft, indoor lighting, standing in a luxurious living room with a blurred background of polished mahogany walls, plush cream sofas, and flickering candles, her calm blue eyes and subtle smile evoking elegance and intimacy, a delicate gold ring catching the light, the scene enriched by the faint scent of jasmine and the warm glow of a chandelier, creating a photorealistic portrait of timeless beauty and refined sophistication.
