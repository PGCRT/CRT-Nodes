(Historical/Intrigue) A low-angle shot in a 1960s Cold War spy exchange on a foggy bridge. A captured agent is being swapped. As the two agents pass each other, one subtly slips a microfilm capsule into the other's hand during the handshake. An extreme close-up, slow-motion shot captures the tiny object passing between fingers, a world-changing secret exchanged in a split second. Tense, grey color palette, high drama.
