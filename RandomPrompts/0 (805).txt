Medium shot of a woman in her late 20s with short, copper hair, wearing a faded green jacket, standing beneath a rusted Ferris wheel on an old pier at night—waves crash softly, and faint lights flicker above. Camera slowly tracks in as she pulls a small, tarnished locket from her pocket, her fingers tracing its engraved surface—her expression shifts from curious to aching. Close-up on her face as she opens the locket, a tear catching the moonlight—the pier blurs into a shimmering veil of silver and blue, isolating her in a moment of quiet grief.
