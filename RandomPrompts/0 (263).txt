A photograph of a young woman with long brown hair, wearing a white shirt and black pants, sitting on a green bench in a public square. She is reading a book, with her head resting on the bench. The background shows a busy street with people walking and carrying bags. The lighting is soft and natural, casting gentle shadows. The woman has a peaceful expression on her face. The image has a watermark in the bottom right corner.
