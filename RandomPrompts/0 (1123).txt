In a gothic, candle-lit university, Professor Annelise, a historian of forbidden texts, uses white-gloved hands to open a book bound in human skin. Her face is a mixture of academic curiosity and primal fear. | She translates a passage aloud, her voice trembling slightly. The spell is for "viewing an echo of the past." | The air in the room shimmers, and a ghostly, translucent image of the book's previous owner appears before herâ€”a screaming, terrified man from the 14th century who is being burned at the stake. His ghostly eyes lock with hers, and he points a finger directly at her as if he can see her across the centuries.
