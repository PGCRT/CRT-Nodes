(Thriller) A woman is being followed. She ducks into a hall of mirrors at a carnival to escape. The camera follows her into the maze. She looks around at the infinite reflections of herself. She stops, terrified, as one of her reflections smirks and turns to walk away in a different direction. Disorienting, classic suspense with a twist.
