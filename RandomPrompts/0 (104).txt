(Surreal/Documentary) A perfect imitation of a David Attenborough nature documentary. The camera patiently observes a herd of "Origami Giraffes" made of folded paper, grazing on the leaves of a glass forest. Attenborough's gentle, academic voiceover describes their migration patterns as one of the creatures delicately dips its head to drink from a river of flowing mercury. Whimsical, strange, visually stunning.
