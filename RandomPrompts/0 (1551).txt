A cinematic shot of a woman named "Silas," a master assassin, lying prone on a skyscraper, her high-tech sniper rifle aimed at a target a mile away. Her face is calm and professional. | Her target, a reclusive cult leader, steps onto his balcony. Her advanced scope identifies him and highlights him in red. | The scope's software suddenly glitches, and for a split second, the red highlight disappears from the leader and reappears on the face of a small child standing next to him, before flickering back. Silas freezes, her finger hovering over the trigger, as the horrifying possibility of a software hack or a deeper conspiracy paralyzes her.
