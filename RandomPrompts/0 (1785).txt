(Action/Fantasy) A warrior with a flaming sword battles a hydra in a water-logged ancient ruin. The camera is mounted on the hilt of the sword, giving a dizzying, first-person perspective of every swing, parry, and a terrifying close-up of the monster's snapping jaws and spitting venom. Intense, visceral, first-person-shooter style cinematography.
