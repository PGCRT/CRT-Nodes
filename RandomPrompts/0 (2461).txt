A woman named Seraphina is the last "Lamplighter," whose job is to climb a mountain every night and light a magical beacon that keeps "the things in the dark" at bay. | One night, she slips and badly sprains her ankle, unable to make the climb. | As darkness falls and monstrous shapes begin to stir in the valley, she sees a tiny light appear at the base of the mountainâ€”a single villager with a lantern, starting the climb for her, soon joined by another, and another.
