A woman with fair skin and long brown hair is walking down the street, wearing a gray tank top and black leggings. She is accompanied by a man in a blue jacket and black pants, who is walking behind her. The street is bustling with people, some sitting and some standing, and there are tables with potted plants. The background is slightly blurred, but it appears to be an outdoor market. The woman is wearing high heels and has a confident stride.
