Medium shot of a woman in her late 20s with sleek, platinum hair in a low bun, wearing a black satin dress, standing at the edge of a neon-lit rooftop bar at midnight—city lights pulse below, and a cool breeze carries distant music. Camera slowly pushes in as she pulls a small, silver cigarette case from her clutch, her fingers lingering on an engraved initial—her lips part, a flicker of pain crossing her face. Close-up on her profile as she opens the case to reveal a single pressed flower, a tear catching the neon glow—the skyline blurs into a vibrant blur of pink and blue, suspending her in a moment of silent grief.
