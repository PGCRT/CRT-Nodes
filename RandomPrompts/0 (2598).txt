A vibrant woman with long, wavy blonde hair styled in loose, golden curls that cascade past her waist, wearing a form-fitting emerald gown with intricate beadwork that highlights her voluptuous breasts and rounded hips, her smooth, tanned skin shimmering under warm, baroque candlelight, standing in a lavish cathedral with a blurred background of gilded altars, stained-glass windows, and marble columns, her direct gaze and bold smile conveying confidence, a delicate gold rosary catching the light, the scene enriched by the faint scent of incense, the soft hum of a choir, and the rustle of silk, creating a striking, photorealistic baroque portrait that emphasizes her radiant physique and the opulent, spiritual energy of a grand, historical sanctuary.
