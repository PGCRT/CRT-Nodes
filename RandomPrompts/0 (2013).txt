Medium shot of a woman in her late 20s with short, auburn hair, wearing a navy raincoat, standing on a rain-soaked boardwalk at night—neon arcade lights flicker, reflecting in puddles. Camera slowly tracks in as she pulls a small, waterlogged photograph from her pocket, her fingers trembling as she studies it—her expression shifts from composed to aching. Close-up on her face as a tear mixes with the rain, catching the neon glow—the boardwalk blurs into a vibrant blur of red and blue, isolating her in a moment of silent grief.
