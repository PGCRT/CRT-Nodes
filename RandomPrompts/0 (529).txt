Medium shot of a woman in her early 30s with sleek, jet-black hair in a high ponytail, wearing a leather jacket, standing in a dimly lit arcade at night—neon lights pulse from old machines, casting vibrant reflections across the tiled floor. Camera slowly dollies in as she approaches a claw machine, her hand fishing a crumpled ticket from her pocket—her brow furrows, a flicker of recognition crossing her face as she reads the faded print. Close-up on her face as she presses her hand against the glass, her eyes shimmering with a mix of hope and loss—the arcade lights blur into a kaleidoscope of pink and blue, framing her in a moment of quiet yearning.
