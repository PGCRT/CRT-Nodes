45. Hyperrealistic image set in the High Middle Ages, radiating a mood of solemn devotion and quiet strength. The subject is a scribe with a soft and rounded body, pale ivory skin with visible pores, ash blonde hair in a Dutch braid crown, and no makeup with laugh lines. The artistic style is inspired by Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, with a warm golden hour palette. Shot on ARRI Alexa LF with a Cooke S4/i 85mm lens, featuring soft blooming highlights and shallow depth of field. High-angle close-up, static, capturing the scribe writing in a monastery, their expression focused with a faint smile.
