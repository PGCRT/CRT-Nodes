(Historical/Supernatural) A lone Confederate soldier, fleeing through a misty Gettysburg battlefield at night, stumbles into a Union army encampment. He freezes, but the Union soldiers around the campfires are all translucent, ghostly figures, quietly cleaning their rifles and staring into the flames, forever trapped repeating the night before the battle. Haunting, somber, atmospheric.
