21. Hyperrealistic image set in the 1990s Grunge era, radiating a mood of raw rebellion and quiet vulnerability. The subject is a poet with a lanky body, pale ivory skin with acne blemishes, jet black hair in a shag haircut, and smudged “day after” eyeliner with thin 90s eyebrows. The artistic style is inspired by graphic novel (Frank Miller’s Sin City), with a high-contrast monochrome palette. Shot on Arriflex 16SR with a wide-angle 18mm lens, featuring light leaks and chromatic aberration. Profile shot, static, capturing the poet writing in a dimly lit coffee shop, their expression intense with a furrowed brow.
