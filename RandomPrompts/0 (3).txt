(Psychological Thriller) A man is in an anechoic chamber, a room designed to be perfectly silent. After a few moments, he begins to hear his own heartbeat, then the sound of blood flowing in his veins. The camera is an extreme close-up on his ear. The sounds become distorted, twisting into faint, menacing whispers that only he (and the audience) can hear, driving him to madness in the absolute quiet. Minimalist, auditory horror.
