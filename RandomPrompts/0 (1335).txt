(Steampunk/Discovery) An inventor in a cluttered Victorian workshop pulls a lever on a massive, brass and copper machine covered in gauges. The machine whirs to life, and a beam of light projects onto the wall. It is not a moving picture, but a live, shimmering portal showing a bustling street scene from 21st-century Tokyo. A close-up on the inventor's goggles shows his mind-blown reflection. Gaslamp fantasy meets sci-fi.
