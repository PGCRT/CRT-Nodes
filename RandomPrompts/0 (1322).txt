25. Photorealistic image set in the 1960s Mod Culture, radiating a mood of youthful rebellion and vibrant energy. The subject is a model with a twiggy-esque thin body, dewy luminous skin with faux freckles, platinum blonde hair in a pixie cut, and bold graphic eyeliner with thin 90s eyebrows. The artistic style is inspired by Pop Art (Warhol), with a saturated jewel-toned palette. Shot on Super 8mm camera with a standard 35mm lens, featuring heavy film grain and light leaks. Profile shot, static, showing the model posing in a geometric dress against a colorful backdrop, their expression confident with a smirk.
