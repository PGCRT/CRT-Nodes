A young woman with fair skin and brown hair, wearing a pink crop top and blue plaid shirt, standing in the middle of a bustling night market. She is holding a phone in her hand and has a serious expression on her face. The market is filled with colorful neon lights, and there are several people walking around, some of them carrying bags. The background is slightly blurred, but it appears to be an urban setting. The woman is wearing black sandals and a green necklace. The image is taken from a low angle, looking up at the woman.
