A young woman with long, curly brown hair, wearing a black turtleneck sweater and yellow plaid pants, leaning against a metal pole in an urban setting. She is looking over her shoulder with a confident expression. The background features a vibrant, abstract painting with a mix of abstract shapes and colors, including red, blue, yellow, and black. The painting is framed by a brick wall with the word "BKFOX" written in white. The woman is positioned in the center of the image, with the street stretching out in front of her.
