The image captures a woman from behind, her back turned towards the viewer. She has long blonde hair cascading down her back, complemented by white straps that wrap around her shoulders and upper back. The strap is tied at the back of her head, suggesting she might be in motion or perhaps paused mid-step.

In her hands, she holds a large bouquet of roses. The roses are predominantly pink with hints of white, creating a soft, pastel hue that matches the overall serene and elegant mood of the photograph. The arrangement appears to be quite substantial, indicating it could be for an event such as a wedding or formal occasion where floral arrangements are customary.

The background is a bright, clean space, likely a room with a light-colored floor and walls. There's a sense of openness and simplicity, which brings out the subject without any distractions. The lighting seems natural, probably coming from windows not visible in the frame, contributing to the calm and tranquil atmosphere of the scene.

There are no other objects or people in this picture; the focus remains solely on the woman and the beautiful bouquet she carries. This composition emphasizes the beauty and tranquility often associated with floral displays.
