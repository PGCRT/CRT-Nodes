A blonde woman riding a skateboard down the street next to a black car. She is wearing a sleeveless black dress with a floral pattern, fishnet stockings, and black and white sneakers. She has a red bag slung over her shoulder. The background shows a busy street with people walking and sitting, as well as a building with a sign that says "Tow Zone." The woman appears to be in her mid-twenties, with a slender physique and fair skin.
