A young woman with fair skin and brown hair walking on a square in front of a large brick building. She is wearing a light pink blouse with short blue denim shorts and brown sandals. In the background, two women are walking, one in a blue dress and the other in a green and white patterned dress. The woman in the blue dress is holding a camera and appears to be taking a picture. The square is empty, with a black lamppost in the foreground. The image has a high-quality, professional feel.
