(Sci-Fi/Utopia) A father teaches his daughter to ride a hover-bike in a park on a terraformed Mars. The sky is a pale pink, and in the distance, the shimmering domes of a city rise against the Olympus Mons volcano. The mood is peaceful, domestic, and heartwarming, showing a hopeful, idyllic future for humanity. Bright, optimistic lighting, family-focused.
