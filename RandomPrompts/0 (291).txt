A low-angle shot of a woman named 'Mama Durga', a community leader in a slum built on the back of a colossal, dormant turtle, as she stands defiantly before corporate developers in clean suits. | The developers present her with an eviction notice, stating the "land" has been sold for development. | Mama Durga smiles sadly, kneels down, and places her hand on the ground, whispering a single word in an ancient language. The entire "slum" lurches as the colossal turtle begins to wake up, lifting its head from the sea and carrying the entire community away from the stunned, helpless developers.
