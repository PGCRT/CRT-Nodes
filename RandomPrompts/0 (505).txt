20. Cinematic image set in the 1980s Neon Noir, conveying a mood of brooding intensity and urban isolation. The subject is a private investigator with a lanky body, pale ivory skin with faint scars, neon blue hair in a quiff, and smudged “day after” eyeliner with a sharp jawline. The artistic style is inspired by David Lynch’s surrealism, with a neon palette of pinks and blues. Shot on Arriflex 16SR with a wide-angle 18mm lens, featuring light leaks and chromatic aberration. Over-the-shoulder shot, static, showing the investigator staring into a rainy cityscape from a rooftop, their expression weary with a furrowed brow.
