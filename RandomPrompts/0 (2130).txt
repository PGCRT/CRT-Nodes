Medium shot of a woman in her early 30s with curly, chestnut hair tucked under a wool scarf, wearing a forest-green parka, standing on a misty mountain path at dawn—jagged peaks loom faintly through the fog, and dew clings to pine needles. Camera slowly arcs around her as she opens a small, leather-bound sketchbook, her fingers brushing over a pencil drawing of a cabin—her expression hardens, eyes glistening with resolve. Close-up on her face as she clutches the sketchbook, a tear catching the soft morning light—the path blurs into a hazy blend of green and gray, isolating her in a moment of quiet determination.
