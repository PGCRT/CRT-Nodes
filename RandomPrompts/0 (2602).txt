(Historical/Action) A dynamic, long-take shot follows a single Aztec Eagle Warrior during the fall of Tenochtitlan. The camera weaves through brutal street-to-street fighting, capturing his desperate, acrobatic combat against steel-clad Conquistadors in the chaos of the burning, sinking city. Gritty, immersive, 'The Revenant'-style realism.
