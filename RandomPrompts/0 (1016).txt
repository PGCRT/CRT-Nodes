A slow, elegant dolly shot moves through a lavish, 1920s jazz club, the air thick with cigar smoke and the sound of a soulful saxophone. It finds a mysterious woman named Seraphina, her face partially obscured by a feathered hat, sitting alone at a secluded table, her fingers tracing the rim of a cocktail glass. | A desperate-looking man approaches her table and slides a faded photograph towards herâ€”a picture of a woman who looks exactly like Seraphina, but dressed in 1890s attire. "They said you could help me find her," he whispers, his voice trembling. | Seraphina looks at the photo without surprise, her eyes filled with an ancient sadness. She reaches into her purse and produces an identical, but much older and more worn photograph of the same woman. "I am always found, eventually," she says softly. "But I am never caught." Her face remains unchanged as the desperate man's face contorts in horrified realization of her immortality.
