(Horror) A first-person POV shot from someone navigating their dark house with a cell phone flashlight. The beam sweeps across a hallway. It passes a doorway. The person stops, and slowly sweeps the light back to the doorway. Standing in the frame is their own doppelg√§nger, holding an identical phone, also pointing the flashlight beam directly at them. High shock value, uncanny horror.
