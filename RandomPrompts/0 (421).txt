A young woman with long, wavy brown hair and fair skin stands outdoors, wearing a grey oversized sweater and a white shirt. She is holding a pair of glasses in her hands, looking off to the side with a thoughtful expression. The background is a blurred cityscape with a bus and trees. The image has a soft, dreamy quality with a watermark in the bottom right corner.
