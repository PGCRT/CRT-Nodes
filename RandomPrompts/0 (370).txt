(Horror) A child is talking to their imaginary friend, who is off-screen. The child says, "You can't have my eyes." A beat of silence. The child's tone becomes fearful. "No, please... they're mine..." The camera stays on the child's face as their eyes suddenly turn a solid, milky white. The horror happens entirely through dialogue and a single visual change.
