20. Cinematic image set in the Qing Dynasty China, conveying a mood of quiet dignity and suppressed longing. The subject is a scholar with a slender neck and body, pale ivory skin with faint beauty marks, jet black hair in an intricate topknot, and no makeup with a soft jawline. The artistic style is inspired by Symbolism (Klimt), with a warm metallic palette of golds and bronzes. Shot on Sony Venice with a Cooke S4/i 50mm lens, featuring soft blooming highlights and fine film grain. Profile shot, static, showing the scholar writing calligraphy at a lacquered desk, their expression contemplative with a furrowed brow.
