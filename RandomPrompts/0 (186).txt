(Fantasy/Horror) An adventurer steals a fist-sized ruby from the eye socket of a giant stone idol in a crumbling temple. | As he pulls it free, the temple begins to shake, and the stone idol's remaining eye swivels to look at him. Cracks spread across its face as it slowly begins to stand up, scraping against the temple ceiling. | The camera crash-zooms onto the adventurer's face, pale with the realization that he has awoken the temple's guardian. Classic adventure-horror, Raiders of the Lost Ark tension.
