Medium shot of a woman in her late 20s with sleek, silver hair, wearing a black wool coat, standing on a snowy city rooftop at dusk—city lights pulse below, and snowflakes drift gently. Camera slowly arcs around her as she pulls a small, tarnished telescope from her bag, her hands adjusting its lens—her expression shifts from focused to wistful. Close-up on her face as she peers through the telescope, a tear catching the city’s glow—the skyline blurs into a sparkling veil of white and silver, framing her in a moment of quiet wonder.
