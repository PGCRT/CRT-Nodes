A wide shot of a woman named "Silence" standing in the center of a chaotic battlefield. She is a warrior monk who has taken a vow of silence. | Soldiers are screaming, explosions are everywhere. She closes her eyes and takes a single, deep, meditative breath. | The silence around her becomes a tangible weapon, spreading outwards in a wave that deafens the soldiers and smothers the explosions, bringing the entire battle to a stunned, silent halt.
