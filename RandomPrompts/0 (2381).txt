(Sci-Fi/Drama) An elderly woman sits in a minimalist apartment, looking at a blank wall. She taps her temple. | The wall flickers to life, showing a perfect, photorealistic beach scene from her youth, with a young man smiling at her. This is a memory playback. She smiles wistfully. | She taps her temple again, and the young man glitches, his face distorting into a horrifying digital scream as the words "MEMORY CORRUPTED" flash in red. Close-up on the woman's face, her smile gone, replaced by profound loss and horror. High-tech melancholy, clean aesthetic, emotional gut-punch.
