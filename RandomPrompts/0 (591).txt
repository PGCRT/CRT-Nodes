A woman named Alani is the last living descendant of a line of Atlantean map-makers. She lives a normal life as a marine biologist. | During a deep dive, her submersible's lights fail, but she sees a faint, glowing line on the seafloor. | She follows the line, and it leads her to a massive, hidden city under a dome, which lights up in welcome as her genetically-keyed vessel approaches.
