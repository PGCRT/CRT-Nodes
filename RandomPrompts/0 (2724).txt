(Action/Comedy) A low-angle tracking shot follows a Corgi, outfitted in a tiny, tactical doggy-vest, as it sprints heroically through a chaotic bank robbery scene. It dodges bullets in slow-motion, trips a robber with its leash, and finally retrieves a dropped grenade, dropping it into an empty fish tank just before it explodes, wagging its tail triumphantly. John Wick, but with a Corgi.
