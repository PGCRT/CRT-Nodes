(Fantasy) In an ancient, library-like hall, a blindfolded acolyte levitates, cross-legged, in the center of the room. A slow orbital shot circles her. As she chants, the books on the shelves open by themselves, and the glowing text lifts from the pages, swirling around her in a tornado of luminous, golden words and arcane symbols. Cinematic, magical, Harry Potter's Room of Requirement meets Doctor Strange.
