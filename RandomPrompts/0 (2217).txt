(Surreal/Comedy) An overhead shot of a business meeting in a hyper-modern, sterile boardroom. Everyone is in identical grey suits. The CEO at the head of the table opens his mouth to speak, but instead of words, a stream of brilliant, colorful butterflies flutters out, filling the room with chaos and wonder as the other executives stare in stunned silence. Deadpan humor, hyper-realistic, vivid color contrast.
