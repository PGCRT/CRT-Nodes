A photograph of three young women with long, curly hair and fair skin. The woman on the left is wearing a black and white checkered hat with the word "Givenchy" on it, a grey sweater, and a black jacket. She is standing in the middle of the image, looking directly at the camera with a neutral expression. The other two women are on the right side of the frame. The background is blurred, but it appears to be an outdoor setting with other people in the background. The lighting is soft and natural, highlighting the women's faces and the texture of their hair.
