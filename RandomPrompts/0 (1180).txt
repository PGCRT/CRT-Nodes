A cinematic shot of a woman named Lyra, a "dream-hunter," walking through a surreal, shifting landscape inside a king's mind. | She finds the source of the king's madness: a memory of his first love, which has become a parasitic, all-consuming entity within his subconscious. | Instead of destroying it, she finds a memory of the king as a lonely child and gently guides the two memories together. The parasitic memory calms, turning from a monster into a sad, peaceful companion, healing the king's mind.
