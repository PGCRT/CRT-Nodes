A sweeping aerial shot shows a woman named Dr. Lena Hanson standing on the edge of a massive, perfectly circular, and impossibly deep hole in the Siberian wilderness. The hole appeared overnight. | She rappels down into the darkness. Her lights reveal the walls are not rock, but a smooth, organic-looking, chitinous material. | She reaches the bottom, which is soft and pulsating. The hole isn't an impact crater; it's the burrow of something that has hatched. She looks up and sees the sky is now blotted out by a colossal, winged shadow.
