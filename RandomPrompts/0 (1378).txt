Medium shot of a woman in her late 20s with curly, chestnut hair pinned up, wearing a faded red cardigan, standing on an abandoned rooftop cinema at night—stars glitter above, and a tattered screen flickers with ghostly static. Camera slowly pushes in as she steps toward a pile of old film reels, her fingers brushing over a dusty canister labeled with faded handwriting—her lips part, a flicker of nostalgia crossing her face. Close-up on her profile as she holds the reel to her chest, a tear catching the starlight—the city skyline blurs into a sparkling haze of indigo and silver, suspending her in a moment of wistful memory.
