Medium shot of a woman in her late 20s with long, dark brown hair, wearing a moss-green shawl, standing on a forested riverbank at sunrise—water glints through overhanging willows, and golden light pierces the morning mist. Camera slowly arcs around her as she kneels to pick up a small, carved wooden figurine half-buried in the moss—her face stills, eyes softening with recognition. Close-up on her profile as she clutches the figurine, a tear shimmering in the sunlight—the riverbank blurs into a radiant tapestry of green and gold, suspending her in a moment of quiet wonder.
