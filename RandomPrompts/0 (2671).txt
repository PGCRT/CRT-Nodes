A young woman with fair skin and brown hair, sitting on a wooden bench in the middle of a cobblestone street. She has a tattoo on her right shoulder and is wearing a sleeveless black and white lace dress. Her left hand is resting on her knee, and her right hand is holding a brown leather handbag. She is looking to the side, with a contemplative expression. In the background, there are parked cars and a few shops with signs. The image is slightly blurred, giving it a dreamy quality.
