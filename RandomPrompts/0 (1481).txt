In a grimy, forgotten back-alley automaton repair shop lit by a single bare bulb, a young, grease-stained mechanic named Pip works diligently. She has a look of fierce concentration as she uses delicate tools to repair the intricate clockwork hand of a decommissioned, life-sized ballerina automaton. | She finds a hidden compartment in the automaton's chest containing a small, brass music box cylinder. Overcome with curiosity, she slots it into the automaton's chest mechanism and turns a small key. | The automaton's eyes snap open, glowing a soft blue, and it rises gracefully to its feet. Instead of dancing, it speaks in a soft, recorded female voice, a last message from its long-dead creator, revealing the location of a hidden political conspiracy and a treasure that could topple the city's corrupt government. Pip stares, her simple repair job now a dangerous legacy.
