In a vast, silent, cryo-sleep chamber aboard a generation starship, a lone technician, Anya, conducts a routine diagnostic. The chamber is filled with thousands of glowing stasis pods, each containing a sleeping colonist. Her movements are practiced and monotonous. | The system flags an anomaly in a single pod. She overrides the seal and opens it, expecting a medical issue. Inside, the colonist is gone, and the pod is filled with strange, perfectly geometric, crystalline structures that hum with a low energy. | She reaches in to touch one of the crystals, and it flashes with light. A wave of collective, alien thought invades her mindâ€”the silent, patient consciousness of the crystalline entity that has already consumed the colonist and is now wearing his memory as a disguise, and it whispers in her mind, "We are awake now. Thank you for opening the door."
