Medium shot of a woman in her late 20s with long, dark blonde hair, wearing a heavy gray scarf, standing on a coastal cliff path at dusk—waves crash below, and a stormy sky churns above. Camera slowly arcs around her as she pulls a small, sealed letter from her coat, her hands trembling as she breaks the wax seal—her lips tremble, eyes hardening with resolve. Close-up on her profile as a tear rolls down her cheek, catching the fading light—the sea blurs into a turbulent wash of gray and blue, suspending her in a moment of fierce determination.
