(Historical/Horror) A plague doctor during the Black Death walks through a deserted, fog-shrouded medieval town. A handheld tracking shot follows his bird-like mask. He stops, hearing a child's laughter. He turns to see a little girl, seemingly healthy, playing with a doll. As he approaches, she looks up, her eyes are solid, milky white, and the laughter continues without her mouth moving. Atmospheric dread, unsettling sound design.
