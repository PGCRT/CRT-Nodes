(Sci-Fi/Utopia) A beautiful, seamless shot of a "sentient weather" system on a terraformed planet. A farmer needs her fields watered. She performs a series of gestures, like a conductor, and a single, fluffy white cloud detaches from the sky, floats over her field, and gently rains, dissipating once the job is done. A harmonious blend of nature and technology.
