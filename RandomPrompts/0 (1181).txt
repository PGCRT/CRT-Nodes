34. Photorealistic image set in a Contemporary urban setting, radiating a mood of quiet introspection and urban isolation. The subject is a street artist with a gamine body, dewy luminous skin with tattoos, neon blue hair in an asymmetrical undercut, and bold graphic eyeliner with a high-fashion editorial look. The artistic style is inspired by Wes Andersonâ€™s symmetrical aesthetic, with a pastel palette. Shot on Sony FX9 with a Lensbaby lens, featuring selective focus and dreamy bokeh. Dutch angle, static, showing the artist painting a mural on a brick wall, their expression focused with a furrowed brow.
