(Biopunk/Action) A close-up on a fugitive's arm. It ripples and morphs, sprouting a living weaponâ€”a 'pistol' made of bone and sinew that fires razor-sharp, crystalline projectiles. A fast-paced chase sequence ensues through a grimy, Giger-esque organic city, with the fugitive's body constantly adapting, growing temporary wings or chameleon-like skin to evade capture. Visceral, grotesque, high-octane body horror.
