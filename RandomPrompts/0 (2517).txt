Medium shot of a woman in her late 20s with long, silver-blonde hair cascading down her back, wearing a flowing sapphire dress, standing in the center of a decayed ballroom—chandeliers hang crookedly, and moonlight streams through shattered windows, illuminating cracked marble floors. Camera slowly pushes in as she steps toward a dusty gramophone, her fingers brushing over a worn record—her face softens, a wistful smile forming as she sets the needle down, and a faint melody crackles to life. Close-up on her eyes as they shimmer with unshed tears, the moonlight catching the dust motes swirling around her—the ballroom fades into a dreamy blur of silver and shadow, suspending her in a moment of nostalgic grace.
