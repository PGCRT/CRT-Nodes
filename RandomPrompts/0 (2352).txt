26. Cinematic image set in a High Fantasy kingdom, conveying a mood of heroic valor and quiet sacrifice. The subject is a knight with a broad-shouldered and powerful body, tanned golden skin with faint scars, chestnut brown hair in a short crop, and no makeup with a sharp jawline. The artistic style is inspired by fantasy art (Frazetta), with a warm golden hour palette. Shot on ARRI Alexa LF with a Cooke S4/i 50mm lens, featuring soft blooming highlights and fine film grain. Low-angle wide shot, static, framing the knight standing on a castle rampart, gripping a sword, their expression resolute with narrowed eyes.
