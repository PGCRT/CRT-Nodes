A gritty shot of a woman named "Slick," a master cat burglar, perched on a gargoyle overlooking a moonlit city. She is dressed in a dark, high-tech infiltration suit. | She ziplines silently to the penthouse of a corrupt CEO and bypasses the security with ease. She opens his safe, expecting diamonds or bearer bonds. | The safe is empty except for a single, old, worn teddy bear. As she touches it, a hidden speaker in the bear activates, playing a recorded message in the CEO's voice, a tearful confession of his crimes, which he recorded as a child for his favorite toy.
