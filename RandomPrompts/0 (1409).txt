Photograph of three women walking down a city street, all wearing casual summer outfits. The woman on the left is wearing a pink off-the-shoulder dress, the woman in the middle has blonde hair, and the woman at the right has dark hair. All three women are smiling and looking at their phones. The street is bustling with people, buildings, and a potted plant. The sky is clear and bright. The image is high quality and has a watermark in the bottom right corner.
