A woman with short, red hair and fair skin, wearing a white blouse with black stripes, sitting on a bench in an indoor setting. She is looking to the side with a thoughtful expression, her hand resting on her chin. Behind her, a man with dark hair and a green jacket is sitting, partially covered by a green blanket. The background is blurred, with a red railing and a metal bench. The lighting is soft and natural, casting gentle shadows. The image has a watermark in the bottom right corner.
