Medium shot of a woman in her early 30s with long, honey-blonde hair, wearing a burgundy cardigan, standing in the attic of an old library—sunlight streams through a grimy skylight, illuminating swirling dust motes. Camera slowly dollies in as she opens a dusty trunk, revealing a small, leather-bound diary—her face stills, eyes softening with recognition. Close-up on her eyes as they shimmer with tears, the sunlight catching her lashes—the attic blurs into a warm haze of amber and gray, suspending her in a moment of quiet revelation.
