(Sci-Fi/Exploration) A deep-sea submersible's lights cut through the crushing darkness of the Mariana Trench. They illuminate the target: not a creature, but a perfectly smooth, black, geometric monolith standing on the seabed. As the light hits it, the monolith activates, projecting a perfect, 3D star map of an unknown galaxy into the murky water. 2001: A Space Odyssey meets The Abyss, awe and mystery.
