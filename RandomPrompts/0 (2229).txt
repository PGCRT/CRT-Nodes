(Historical/Surreal) A Victorian-era child in a muddy cobblestone alley gently cranks a small music box. Instead of music, miniature, holographic ghosts of horse-drawn carriages and elegantly dressed people swirl out of the box, dancing in the grimy air around her. A low-angle shot captures her face, lit by the ghostly projections, her expression one of quiet wonder. Sepia tones, dusty atmosphere, ethereal lighting.
