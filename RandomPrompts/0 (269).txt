In a magical, bustling city market, a young street urchin named Pip, with quick fingers and quicker wits, tries to pickpocket a seemingly frail old woman. | As Pip's hand touches the woman's pouch, an invisible force field hurls her back. The old woman turns, her eyes twinkling with amusement and immense power. | The "old woman" offers Pip a choice: be turned over to the city guard, or become her apprentice in the magical arts. Pip stares, a look of defiant opportunity dawning on her face.
