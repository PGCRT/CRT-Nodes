5. Cinematic image set in a Near-Future Sci-Fi city, conveying a mood of cold ambition and suppressed fear. The subject is a corporate operative with an androgynous frame, pale ivory skin with cybernetic seams, silver hair in a sleek undercut, and graphic eyeliner with a high-fashion editorial look. The artistic style is inspired by sci-fi concept art (Syd Mead), with a cool metallic palette of silvers and blues. Shot on Sony Venice with an anamorphic 50mm lens, featuring streaky flares and digital noise. Dutch angle, static, capturing the operative standing on a skyscraper balcony, holding a glowing data chip, their expression calculating with a raised eyebrow.
