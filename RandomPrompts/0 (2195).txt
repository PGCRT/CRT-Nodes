A woman in her twenties with long, straight black hair flowing past her waist in a glossy, silken cascade, wearing a delicate lavender lingerie set with intricate lace embroidery that emphasizes her full breasts and toned physique, her radiant, fair skin softly lit by natural daylight streaming through a large bay window, standing in a lush botanical conservatory with a blurred background of vibrant greenery, blooming orchids, and a clear blue sky dotted with fluffy clouds, her serene blue eyes and gentle expression exuding tranquility, a delicate butterfly pendant resting against her collarbone, a faint blush on her cheeks adding warmth, the scene alive with the hum of insects, the rustle of leaves, and the sweet scent of flowers, creating a photorealistic portrait of natural beauty and serene elegance in a vibrant, sunlit setting.
