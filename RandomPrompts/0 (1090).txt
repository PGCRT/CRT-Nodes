(Fantasy/Awe) A slow crane shot ascends from the base of a colossal, petrified waterfall. Embedded within the frozen cascade are the perfectly preserved bodies of two titanic dragons locked in eternal combat. As the camera reaches the apex, the sun breaks through the clouds, illuminating ancient runes carved into the dragons' scales, causing them to glow with a faint, golden light. Lord of the Rings aesthetic, sweeping orchestral mood, magical realism.
