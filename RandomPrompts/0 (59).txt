A woman with long, platinum blonde hair, wearing a white t-shirt, standing in the middle of a busy street. She is holding a black pen in her right hand and a bottle of water in her left hand. She has a serious expression on her face. The background is blurred, but it appears to be a crowd of people, some standing and some walking. The woman is wearing a gold bracelet and a pair of earrings. The image is taken from a low angle, looking up at the woman.
