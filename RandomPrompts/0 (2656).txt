Dr. Isobel Finch, a prim and proper ornithologist, is studying a rare bird in the Amazon. | The bird leads her to a hidden ruin, where she finds an altar with a single, iridescent feather. | When she picks up the feather, she doesn't gain powers, but instead, a perfect, encyclopedic knowledge of every secret, betrayal, and hidden treasure of anyone she looks at. The burden is overwhelming.
