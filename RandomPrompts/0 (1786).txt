A young woman with long, straight, dark hair tied in a high ponytail, wearing a sleeveless black top. She has a tattoo of a yin and yang symbol on her right arm. She is sitting at a table in a dimly lit outdoor cafe, looking off to the side with a serious expression. The background is blurred, with a chain-link fence and a tree trunk visible. The image is in black and white.
