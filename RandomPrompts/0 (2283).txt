A woman with short blonde hair, wearing a beige sweater with the text "Bagette About It" and a pair of yellow camouflage pants, standing in a clothing store. She is holding a pink handbag and has a serious expression. The store has a large window display with mannequins dressed in casual clothing, and a "% off" sign is visible in the background. The lighting is bright and natural. The image is slightly blurred, with a watermark in the bottom right corner.
