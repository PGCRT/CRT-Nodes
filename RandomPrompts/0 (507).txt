A cynical, retired monster hunter, Genevieve, runs a quiet tavern. | A terrified villager begs her to hunt a beast plaguing their town. She refuses. | The villager leaves a small, child's drawing of the "monster." Genevieve recognizes the drawing not as a monster, but as a creature she herself spared years ago, and her face hardens with the realization that her past has come back to haunt her.
