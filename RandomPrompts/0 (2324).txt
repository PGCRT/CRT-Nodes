Medium shot of a woman in her late 20s with long, auburn hair, wearing a quilted navy jacket, standing on a forested lake shore at sunrise—mist rises from the water, and golden light filters through pines. Camera slowly pushes in as she kneels to pick up a small, carved stone from the shore—her face stills, a faint smile breaking through her sorrow. Close-up on her profile as she clutches the stone, a tear catching the sunlight—the lake blurs into a radiant haze of green and gold, framing her in a moment of quiet reverence.
