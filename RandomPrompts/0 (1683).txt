(Sci-Fi/Action) A zero-gravity heist. A thief uses magnetic boots to sprint along the exterior hull of a spinning space station. An orbital camera shot follows her as she dodges automated defense turrets and space debris, the curve of the Earth a stunning, silent backdrop to the intense, silent action. High-stakes, visually spectacular.
