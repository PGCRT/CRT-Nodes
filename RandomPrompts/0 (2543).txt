In a world where magic is strictly licensed, a young woman, Pip, is a magical contraband smuggler. She is cornered in an alley by two grim-faced "Magi-Cops." | She reaches into her coat and throws a handful of what looks like simple glass marbles on the ground. | The marbles instantly sprout into a dense, writhing forest of massive, thorny brambles, creating an impenetrable wall that allows her to escape as the cops are entangled.
