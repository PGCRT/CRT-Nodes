An elderly woman with long blonde hair, wearing a black sleeveless top and black pants, walking on a street with crutches. She is holding a blue and white tote bag in her right hand and has a serious expression on her face. The background shows a busy street with people sitting at tables and yellow umbrellas, and a building with a red awning. The image has a soft, natural lighting and a watermark in the bottom right corner.
