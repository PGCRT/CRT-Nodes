Medium shot of a woman in her early 30s with long, dark brown hair, wearing a heavy wool shawl, standing among cliffside ruins at sunset—crumbling stones frame a fiery horizon, and a cool breeze stirs her hair. Camera slowly dollies in as she kneels beside a cracked stone tablet, her fingers brushing over faint carvings—her face stills, eyes shimmering with awe. Close-up on her profile as a tear catches the sunset’s glow, reflecting the ruins—the landscape blurs into a radiant tapestry of orange and shadow, framing her in a moment of timeless wonder.
