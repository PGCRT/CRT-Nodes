Photo of two women and a man standing on a stage, both smiling and looking at each other. The woman on the left has blonde hair and is wearing a black and white tweed top and black pants. The man on the right has a black cap and a white t-shirt tied around his waist with a white apron. The background shows a crowd of people, a red banner with white text, and a stage with metal trusses. The image is slightly blurry.
