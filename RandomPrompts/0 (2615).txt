(Fantasy) A young monk is meditating in a serene, mountaintop monastery. He is so still that a hummingbird builds a nest in his cupped hands, lays its eggs, and they hatch. A macro, slow-motion shot shows the tiny chicks emerging from the shells, all while the monk remains perfectly, peacefully motionless. A testament to patience and harmony with nature, beautiful and serene.
