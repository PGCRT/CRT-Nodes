A young woman riding a bicycle on a cobblestone street in Amsterdam, Netherlands. She is wearing a cream-colored, fluffy coat, a white hat, and a pink scarf. The background features traditional Dutch architecture with red-tiled roofs. The woman is positioned in the center of the image, with the bicycle in the foreground. The image is slightly blurred, giving it a dreamy quality.
