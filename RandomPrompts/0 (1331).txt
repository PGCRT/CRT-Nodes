Medium shot of a woman in her late 20s with shoulder-length caramel hair, wearing a faded denim coat, standing in the shadow of a rusted Ferris wheel at twilight—faint carnival music echoes distantly, and the sky glows a soft apricot. Camera slowly tracks in as she pulls a crumpled ticket stub from her pocket, her fingers tracing its torn edge—her expression shifts from calm to wistful, a breeze stirring her hair. Close-up on her face as a tear catches the fading light, her eyes reflecting the wheel’s silhouette—the park blurs into a dreamy haze of orange and purple, isolating her in a moment of quiet longing.
