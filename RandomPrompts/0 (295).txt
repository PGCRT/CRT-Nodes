In a world where magic is dying, a lone sorceress, Ysabel, performs a desperate ritual on a windswept cliff at midnight, trying to draw power from a passing comet. | The comet passes, and a single, tiny fragment breaks off, landing in her ritual circle. It is not rock, but a piece of cold, solid, frozen magic. | She touches the fragment, and instead of gaining power, she sees a vision of a vast, thriving universe of pure magic from which this "comet" was just a pebble, and realizes her world isn't dying, it was intentionally severed from the true source.
