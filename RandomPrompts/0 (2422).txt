16. Photorealistic image set in World War II, evoking a mood of quiet courage and grim resolve. The subject is a resistance fighter with a compact and muscular body, tanned golden skin with dirt, ash brown hair in a messy bun, and no makeup with a sharp jawline. The artistic style is inspired by Italian Neorealism, with a sepia-toned palette. Shot on Arriflex 435 with a spherical 50mm lens, featuring visible dust and scratches and heavy vignetting. Ground-level shot, static, framing the fighter hiding in a ruined building, clutching a radio, their expression tense with wide eyes.
