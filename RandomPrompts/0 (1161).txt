Cinematic medium shot of Captain Eva Rostova, a veteran astronaut on a solo deep-space mission, her face etched with exhaustion but her eyes sharp, as she manually pilots her small survey ship, 'The Odyessy,' through a treacherous asteroid field. Explosions from micrometeorite impacts flash silently outside her cockpit window. | A massive, rogue asteroid tumbles past, and she sees something impossible embedded in its surface: the unmistakable, angular shape of a modern, human-made satellite, impossibly far from Earth. Her flight computer flags it with an I.D. code that hasn't been used in over 200 years. | Ignoring protocol, she matches the satellite's trajectory and uses her ship's robotic arm to retrieve it. As she brings it into the cargo bay, its solar panels unfurl, and a single, red light begins to blink. A heavily distorted, pre-recorded voice crackles over her comms in her own voice, saying, "Warning: Do not return to Earth. The signal is a lie. We are not who we think we are."
