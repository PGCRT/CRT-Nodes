A young woman with fair skin and long brown hair, wearing a long, grey coat with a black fur collar, standing in a subway train. She is looking down at her phone, with a serious expression. The background is blurred, but it appears to be a crowded train station with other passengers. The lighting is soft and natural, coming from the left side of the image. The image is high quality and has a watermark in the bottom right corner.
