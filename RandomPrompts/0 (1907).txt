A confident woman with sleek, jet-black hair styled in a loose, gothic braid adorned with silver raven feathers, wearing a tattered, black lace gown that emphasizes her voluptuous breasts and slender waist, her flawless, pale skin glowing under flickering, crimson torchlight, carving runes into a wooden staff | tossing glowing embers into a brazier in a shadowy crypt with a blurred background of ancient sarcophagi, glowing sigils, and swirling mist, her intense red eyes narrowed in focus, a delicate onyx amulet resting against her collarbone, the scene enriched by the damp scent of stone, the faint toll of bells, and the whisper of ancient spirits, her mystical actions exuding menace, creating a candid, photorealistic gothic video that captures her haunting allure and the eerie, mystical atmosphere of a forsaken tomb at midnight.
