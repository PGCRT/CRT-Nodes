(Fantasy) A wizard and a warrior face each other on a featureless plain. The wizard gestures, and the ground between them erupts, forming a full-scale, intricately detailed medieval castle in seconds, creating an instant battlefield. A sweeping crane shot captures the impossible act of magical construction. High-fantasy, epic scale.
