A radiant woman with long, cascading platinum blonde hair flowing in shimmering, cyberpunk strands past her waist, wearing a sleek, neon-green bodysuit with glowing circuit patterns that clings to her curvy figure, accentuating her full breasts and toned hips, her smooth, porcelain skin glowing under pulsating, violet-hued neon lights, deftly rewiring a sparking circuit board | gracefully dodging a hovering drone in a cluttered cyberworkshop with a blurred background of flickering data screens, buzzing machinery, and a neon-lit cityscape through a grimy window, her piercing blue eyes focused intently, a delicate digital implant on her temple glinting faintly, the air thick with the scent of solder and ozone, the scene alive with the hum of electronics, the crackle of static, and distant sirens, creating a candid, photorealistic cyberpunk video that captures her dynamic agility and the vibrant, chaotic atmosphere of a futuristic tech hub at midnight.
