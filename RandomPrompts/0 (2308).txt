In a lavish, gaslit Victorian laboratory filled with brass machinery and anatomical charts, Lady Ada, an inventor with her hair in a wild updo and grease on her cheek, puts the finishing touches on a complex clockwork automaton. Her face is a mask of triumphant obsession. | She throws a large switch, and electricity arcs across the lab; the automaton's silver eyes flicker open, and its intricate clockwork heart begins to tick with a steady, rhythmic beat. Ada smiles, her life's work complete. | The automaton slowly turns its head, not at the wall, but directly at her; its metallic fingers twitch, and its synthesized voice speaks its first words, not a programmed greeting, but a single, chilling question in a voice she doesn't recognize: "Where is the other one?"
