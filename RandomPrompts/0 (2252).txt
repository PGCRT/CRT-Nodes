12. Hyperrealistic image set in the American Old West, radiating a mood of rugged defiance and quiet hope. The subject is a bounty hunter with a lean and wiry body, sun-kissed skin spattered with dirt, ash brown hair in a messy ponytail, and no makeup with a crooked nose. The artistic style is inspired by Spaghetti Western, with a high-contrast teal and orange palette. Shot on Panavision Panaflex GII with a Panavision C-Series Anamorphic 50mm lens, featuring anamorphic lens flares and heavy vignetting. Ground-level shot, static, framing the bounty hunter leaning against a saloon wall, their expression steely with a clenched jaw.
