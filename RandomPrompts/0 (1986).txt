Medium shot of a woman in her early 30s with short, jet-black hair, wearing a red leather jacket, standing at a neon-lit bus stop at night—rain glistens on the pavement, and a flickering sign casts reflections. Camera slowly tracks in as she pulls a small, folded map from her pocket, her fingers tracing a marked route—her brow furrows, eyes flickering with hope. Close-up on her face as a tear catches the neon glow, reflecting vibrant pinks and blues—the street blurs into a vibrant blur of light and shadow, isolating her in a moment of silent anticipation.
