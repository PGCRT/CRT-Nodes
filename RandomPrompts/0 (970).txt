Medium shot of a woman in her early 30s with long, black hair in a loose braid, wearing a wool shawl, standing in a snowy forest clearing at dawn—pine trees loom, and soft light filters through the mist. Camera slowly pushes in as she kneels to uncover a small, frost-covered locket in the snow—her lips part, eyes softening with recognition. Close-up on her profile as she opens the locket, a tear catching the morning light—the clearing blurs into a serene haze of white and gold, suspending her in a moment of quiet discovery.
