A POV shot from inside the helmet of Captain Eva Rostova, as she stands on the surface of a desolate, red-sand moon. Her only companion is a robotic rover collecting samples. The sky is a terrifying, inky black, filled with alien stars. | Her suit's comm system crackles, and she hears a faint, distorted human voice whispering her name. She checks the comms logâ€”there are no open channels and no other humans within a hundred light-years. The voice whispers again, closer this time. | She spins around, her heart pounding, and sees the robotic rover has stopped moving. It slowly turns its optical sensor towards her, and the whispering voice now comes directly from the rover's external speakers, clear and cold, saying, "You shouldn't have left us behind on Mars, Eva."
