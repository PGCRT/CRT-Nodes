Medium shot of a woman in her late 20s with curly, dark brown hair, wearing a sage-green dress, standing in an overgrown arboretum at sunrise—vines drape over cracked benches, and golden light filters through tangled branches. Camera slowly pushes in as she approaches a small, moss-covered statue, her fingers brushing over a carved inscription—her face stills, a faint smile breaking through her sorrow. Close-up on her eyes as they shimmer with tears, the sunlight catching her lashes—the arboretum blurs into a dreamy haze of green and gold, framing her in a moment of tender reverence.
