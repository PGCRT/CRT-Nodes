(Fantasy) A lone warrior approaches a massive, impassable gate made of black stone. He does not try to force it open. Instead, he pulls out a flute and plays a simple, sad melody. In response, the gate itself begins to weep thick, black tears, which carve a new, smaller doorway for him to pass through. Lyrical, melancholic, unexpected solution.
