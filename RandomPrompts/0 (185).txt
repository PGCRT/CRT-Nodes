A photograph of two young women sitting on a purple bean bag chair in a public restroom. The woman on the left is wearing a red tank top and has her hair tied up in a bun. She is holding a book in her hand and appears to be looking at it. The man on the right is also wearing a white tank top. Both women have fair skin and are wearing shorts. The background shows a metal floor and a concrete wall. The lighting is bright and natural.
