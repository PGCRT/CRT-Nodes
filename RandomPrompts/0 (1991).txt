Two women walking down the street in front of a modern building. The woman on the left is wearing a cream-colored, knitted sweater with a blue floral design, white pants, and black sneakers. She has fair skin and is looking to the side with a neutral expression. The other woman, wearing a light beige, sleeveless dress with a side slit, is also wearing blue heels. She is holding a smartphone in her hand. Both women have long brown hair and are wearing sunglasses. The background shows a large glass door with geometric patterns. The image is high quality and has a watermark in the bottom right corner.
