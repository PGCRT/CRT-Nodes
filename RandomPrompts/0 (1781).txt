In the heart of a vibrant, chaotic cyberpunk city, a data-courier named Jona, with pink hair and glowing cybernetic eyes, weaves her motorcycle through dense traffic. A package containing a stolen data-chip is strapped to her back. | She checks her side-mirror and sees two corporate enforcers in sleek, black vehicles closing in fast. She grits her teeth, revs the engine, and swerves into a dangerously narrow market alleyway, sending stalls flying. | She bursts out of the alley and onto a massive, multi-level suspension bridge, but the enforcers are right behind her. With no other choice, she guns the engine, drives straight off the side of the bridge, and activates a hidden anti-gravity modification, her bike converting into a hovercraft as she plummets towards the lower levels of the city.
