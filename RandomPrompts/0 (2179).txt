Medium shot of a woman in her late 20s with long, honey-blonde hair blowing in the wind, wearing a thick gray sweater, standing at a mountain lookout as dusk settles—jagged peaks loom in the distance, and a faint mist curls below. Camera slowly pushes in as she opens a small tin box, revealing a bundle of handwritten letters tied with twine—her lips part slightly, eyes softening with a pang of memory as she unties the knot. Close-up on her face as she reads the top letter, a tear catching the last rays of sunlight—the mountains blur into a soft tapestry of purple and gold, suspending her in a moment of bittersweet reflection.
