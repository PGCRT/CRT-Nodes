A poised woman with long, straight raven hair cascading past her hips in a glossy, silken sheet, wearing a plunging black leather outfit with brutalist steel accents that showcases her full breasts and curvy hips, her tanned skin shimmering under harsh, industrial fluorescent lights, standing on a concrete platform with a blurred background of stark, geometric skyscrapers and rusted metal structures, her confident smile and piercing grey eyes radiating strength and defiance, a heavy iron choker glinting against her skin, the scene enriched by the distant hum of machinery, the faint scent of oil and concrete dust, and the echo of footsteps on hard surfaces, creating a gritty, high-resolution brutalist portrait that captures her bold beauty and the stark, utilitarian atmosphere of a dystopian urban landscape.
