A poised woman with long, straight chestnut hair cascading past her hips in a glossy sheet, wearing a plunging leather jacket with rusted studs that showcases her full breasts, her tanned skin shimmering under flickering, post-apocalyptic firelight, salvaging wires from a broken console | leaping over a collapsed beam in a ruined factory with a blurred background of shattered machinery, glowing embers, and a smoky, crimson sky, her confident blue eyes focused on her task, a scarred leather band glinting on her wrist, the air heavy with the scent of ash and rust, her swift movements exuding resilience, the scene alive with the crunch of debris, the crack of gunfire, and the howl of wind, creating a candid, photorealistic post-apocalyptic video that captures her fierce beauty and the chaotic, perilous atmosphere of a ruined wasteland at dusk.
