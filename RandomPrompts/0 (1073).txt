A young woman with fair skin and brown hair tied up in a messy bun, wearing a black leather jacket, a white shirt, and a grey sweater. She is walking down the street, with a serious expression on her face. The background is blurred, but it appears to be a busy city street with people walking and holding umbrellas. The image is slightly out of focus, giving it a dreamy quality.
