(Historical/Awe) A Viking shipbuilder hammers the final nail into a new longship. As the nail sinks in, he whispers a Norse rune. The camera follows the grain of the wood as it begins to glow with faint blue light, the ship itself awakening with a low hum, imbued with a soul. A historical scene infused with subtle, powerful magic.
