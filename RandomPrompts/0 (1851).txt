(Fantasy/Comedy) A grand council of imposing, serious-faced wizards in a dark chamber are debating a world-ending prophecy. The camera slowly pushes towards the ancient scroll. In the center of the arcane text and dire warnings is a crudely drawn cartoon duck with the caption "Quack!" The lead wizard squints, adjusts his spectacles, and says with utter seriousness, "What could it mean?" Deadpan, high-fantasy humor.
