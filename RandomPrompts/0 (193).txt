A curvy woman with shoulder-length, curly black hair framing her face in a wild, post-apocalyptic cascade, wearing a tattered, leather bikini with rusted metal studs that accentuates her curvy figure and perky breasts, her weathered, pale skin glowing under flickering, firelit torches, posing defiantly in a ruined cityscape with a blurred background of collapsed buildings, twisted rebar, and a smoky, crimson sky, her expressive amber eyes and fierce smile radiating raw energy, a scarred iron locket glinting against her skin, the scene enriched by the distant crackle of fire, the acrid scent of ash, and the howl of a desolate wind, creating a gritty, high-resolution post-apocalyptic portrait that captures her resilient allure and the harsh, chaotic atmosphere of a dystopian wasteland.
