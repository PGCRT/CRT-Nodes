The image depicts a woman standing in the water, her body turned away from the camera. She is wearing a blue bikini with a halter neck and tie at the back of the top. Her hair is wet and appears to be styled into waves or curls that fall over her shoulders. The background features a sunset sky with hues of pink, purple, and orange blending into darker shades near the horizon. There are no other people or significant objects visible in the immediate vicinity; the focus is solely on the woman and the tranquil waters around her.
