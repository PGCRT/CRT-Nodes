A slender woman with straight, raven-black hair cascading over her shoulders in a sleek, polished cascade, wearing a tight red dress with a plunging neckline and intricate sequin detailing that accentuates her perky breasts and slim figure, her fair skin catching the soft, rosy glow of a sunset filtering through a city skyline, standing on a rooftop terrace with a blurred background of twinkling skyscrapers, neon signs, and a vibrant dusk sky, her calm blue eyes and gentle smile radiating elegance, a delicate gold bracelet shimmering on her wrist, the scene alive with the distant hum of traffic and the faint clink of glasses, creating a photorealistic urban portrait of timeless sophistication and serene beauty.
