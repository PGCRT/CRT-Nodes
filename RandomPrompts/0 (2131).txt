A radiant woman with long, wavy blonde hair cascading in loose curls past her waist, wearing a flowing, ivory toga with gold embroidery that highlights her voluptuous figure, her smooth, tanned skin glowing under the warm light of marble torches, arranging a platter of grapes | sidestepping a passing servant in a grand Roman villa with a blurred background of mosaic floors, marble columns, and open courtyards, her serene hazel eyes focused on her task, a delicate gold armlet catching the light, the air rich with the scent of olives and burning cedar, her graceful movements exuding elegance, the scene alive with the clink of goblets, the rustle of silk, and the distant strum of a lyre, creating a candid, photorealistic Roman video that captures her refined beauty and the opulent, lively atmosphere of an ancient feast at dusk.
