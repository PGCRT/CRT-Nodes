A tracking shot follows "Slick," a master thief in a skin-tight catsuit, as she silently navigates the laser-filled vault of a billionaire. Her movements are like a dancer's. | She reaches the main prize: a pedestal holding the legendary "Eye of the Serpent" diamond. She lifts it, and a hidden pressure plate triggers. | Instead of an alarm, the vault door slams shut, and the room begins to fill with a viscous, green liquid. The "vault" was not a safe; it was the feeding chamber for the billionaire's prized aquatic monster.
