A reclusive author, Cassandra, writes horror stories that have a habit of coming true. She lives in isolation to protect the world. | She is writing a story about a relentless, shadowy creature that hunts by sound. | She hears a floorboard creak just outside her study door, exactly as she just wrote it, and she frantically tries to write a new, happier ending before the creature materializes.
