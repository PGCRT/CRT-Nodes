(Psychological Thriller) A psychiatrist listens patiently to a client. The camera focuses on the psychiatrist's face. | The client says, "And the worst part is, I know you're not real." | The psychiatrist's professional smile doesn't change, but his eyes glitch, showing digital static for a split second before returning to normal. The client smirks knowingly. Subtle horror, unnerving, minimalist setting.
