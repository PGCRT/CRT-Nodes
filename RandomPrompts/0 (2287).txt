Medium shot of a woman in her early 30s with short, honey-blonde hair, wearing a burgundy sweater, standing in a dimly lit bookshop at midnight—shelves tower around her, and a single lantern casts warm shadows across worn spines. Camera slowly pushes in as she pulls a small, leather-bound journal from a shelf, her fingers brushing over a handwritten dedication inside—her eyes widen, lips trembling with recognition. Close-up on her face as she clutches the journal to her chest, a tear catching the lantern’s glow—the shelves fade into a soft blur of amber and brown, leaving her framed in a moment of quiet revelation.
