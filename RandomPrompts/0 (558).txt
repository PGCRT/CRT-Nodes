Medium shot of a woman in her late 20s with wavy dark brown hair, wearing a quilted green jacket, standing outside a lakeside cabin at sunrise—mist rises from the water, and golden light filters through towering pines. Camera slowly arcs around her as she lifts a small brass key from a chain around her neck, her hands trembling as she fits it into the cabin’s lock—her face stills, eyes flickering with anticipation. Close-up on her profile as the door creaks open, sunlight spilling across her features, catching the moisture in her eyes—the lake blurs into a serene wash of blue and gold, framing her in a moment of quiet discovery.
