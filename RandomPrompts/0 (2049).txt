Medium shot of a woman in her early 30s with honey-blonde hair tied in a loose braid, wearing a forest green cloak, standing in a mist-covered meadow at dawn—soft golden light breaks over distant hills, casting long shadows through the haze | Camera slowly tracks forward as she kneels beside a stone marker partially hidden in the grass, her fingers brushing moss from an engraved name—her face stills, the morning air trembling with silence | Close-up on her face as her eyes close and her forehead rests against the cold stone—sunlight catches the moisture on her lashes, and the meadow behind her blurs into a serene, golden dreamscape
