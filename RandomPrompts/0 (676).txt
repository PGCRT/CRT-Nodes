A woman with black hair and glasses, wearing a white sleeveless top, standing in a crowd of people at an outdoor event. She appears to be an elderly Asian woman with a light skin tone and a slender build. She is holding a beer mug in her right hand and has a surprised expression on her face. Behind her, a man with a blue cap and glasses is standing, holding a glass of beer. The background is blurred, but we can see other people in the crowd, some sitting and some standing. The image has a watermark in the bottom left corner.
