(Surreal) A painter is working on a landscape in a field. He is painting a large, fluffy cloud in the sky. As he makes the brushstroke on his canvas, a real, identical cloud materializes in the clear blue sky above him. He 'paints' an entire storm into existence, looking up with a mix of fear and power. Magical realism, creative power made literal.
