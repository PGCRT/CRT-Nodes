A young woman with orange hair tied in a high ponytail, wearing a white face mask and a beige coat with a hood. She is standing in a dimly lit subway station, looking at her phone. The walls are made of concrete and there is a sign on the right side of the image. The lighting is soft and diffused, casting shadows on her face and body. The image is high quality and has a cinematic feel.
