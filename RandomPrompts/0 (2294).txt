In a grimy, neon-lit noodle bar, a woman named Ash, a former corporate enforcer with a cybernetic arm, is trying to live a quiet life. She's eating ramen. | A group of thugs from her old corporation corner her, telling her she can't just walk away. | She sighs, puts down her chopsticks, and then unscrews her entire cybernetic forearm at the elbow, revealing a hidden, high-caliber plasma cannon underneath. She points the glowing weapon at the lead thug and asks, "Were you saying something?"
