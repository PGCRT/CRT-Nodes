A young woman with long, wavy blonde hair, wearing a black baseball cap with a black bear patch on the front, and a gray and purple Chicago sweatshirt with the word "CHICAGO" written on the side. She is smiling and looking directly at the camera. The background is blurred, but it appears to be an outdoor setting with other people in the background. The image is high quality and has a watermark in the bottom right corner.
