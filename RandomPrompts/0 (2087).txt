A confident woman with sleek, jet-black hair styled in a high, elegant bun adorned with gold pins, wearing a form-fitting emerald-green dress with lace sleeves that accentuates her curvaceous figure, her flawless, olive skin shimmering under warm, candlelit chandeliers, arranging a stack of antique books | gracefully adjusting her silk gloves in a grand Victorian study with a blurred background of oak bookshelves, stained-glass lamps, and a crackling fireplace, her intense green eyes sparkling with curiosity, a pearl choker resting against her collarbone, the air rich with the scent of polished wood and old leather, her poised movements exuding sophistication, the scene alive with the soft crackle of fire, the rustle of pages, and the distant toll of a clock, creating a candid, photorealistic Victorian video that captures her refined allure and the opulent, intellectual atmosphere of a 19th-century manor at evening.
