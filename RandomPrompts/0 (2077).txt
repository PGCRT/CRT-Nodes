(Surreal) A slow pan across a crowded beach. Everyone is relaxing and enjoying the sun. The scene is completely normal, except for the fact that everyone is wearing a full, formal 19th-century deep-sea diving suit with the large metal helmet. The sound is of muffled breathing and the gentle lapping of waves. Unsettling, absurd, visually striking.
