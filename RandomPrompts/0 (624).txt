49. Photorealistic image set in Qing Dynasty China, evoking a mood of serene elegance and hidden sorrow. The subject is a poet with a slender neck and body, pale porcelain skin with faint beauty marks, jet black hair in a chignon with ornate pins, and natural makeup with high cheekbones. The artistic style is inspired by watercolor illustration, with a pastel palette. Shot on Canon C500 Mark II with a Leica Summilux-C 50mm lens, featuring creamy bokeh and soft-focus filter. Eye-level medium shot, static, framing the poet writing by a lotus pond, their expression wistful with a faint frown.
