A young, timid woman, Lily, inherits a small, cluttered antique shop from her estranged grandmother. | She finds a box of old, unsold wind-up toys. She winds one upâ€”a tin soldier. | The soldier marches to a specific spot on the floor and taps out a rhythm with its tiny rifle. It's a code, revealing the location of a hidden safe behind the wall.
