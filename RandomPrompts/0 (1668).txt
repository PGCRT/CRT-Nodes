(Sci-Fi/Body Horror) A woman is using a futuristic VR rig. A close-up on her face shows her smiling, experiencing a beautiful virtual world. The camera pulls back slowly. In the real world, her resting physical body is grotesquely and rapidly aging, her skin wrinkling and hair turning grey, her life force being drained to power her perfect digital escape. The Matrix meets Dorian Gray.
