A curvy woman with shoulder-length, curly black hair framing her face in a wild, gothic fantasy cascade, wearing a tattered, blood-red dress with jagged lace that accentuates her curvy figure and perky breasts, her pale skin glowing with a sickly, greenish hue under flickering, ghostly torchlight, wielding a cursed dagger in a defensive stance in a forsaken castle with a blurred background of crumbling stone walls, rusted chandeliers, and shadowy corridors, her expressive red eyes blazing with defiance, a rusted silver locket glinting against her skin, the scene enriched by the creak of ancient wood, the damp scent of mold, and the distant wail of spectral voices, her combat-ready pose exuding menace, creating a chilling, high-resolution gothic fantasy portrait that captures her fierce allure and the foreboding atmosphere of a haunted fortress.
