(Sci-Fi/Satire) An infomercial for a futuristic product: a small device that generates a perfect, agreeable avatar of yourself to attend meetings and social gatherings you want to skip. The screen shows a split view of a man relaxing on a beach while his smiling, nodding, holographic double sits through a boring corporate presentation. Sharp, witty social commentary.
