(Historical/Awe) A seamless drone shot starts on the face of the Sphinx in modern-day Giza, surrounded by tourists. The camera flies backwards, and time reverses. The tourists vanish, the city deconstructs, the sand rises, the nose of the Sphinx reappears, its paint returns, and the shot settles on the monument in its original, vibrant glory, overlooking the bustling construction of the pyramids under a starry sky. Epic time-lapse, historical reconstruction.
