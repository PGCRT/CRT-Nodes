Medium shot of a woman in her early 30s with short, jet-black hair, wearing a leather bomber jacket, sitting at the counter of an empty diner at midnight—neon signs hum softly, casting pink and blue reflections across the chrome. Camera slowly dollies in as she pulls a crumpled postcard from her wallet, her fingers tracing the faded image of a beach—her brow furrows, eyes flickering with longing. Close-up on her face as a tear rolls down her cheek, catching the neon glow—the diner blurs into a vibrant blur of light and shadow, suspending her in a moment of silent yearning.
