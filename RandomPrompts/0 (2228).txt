(Action/Sci-Fi) A woman with cybernetic arms is in a free-fall between two towering skyscrapers. She fires a grappling hook from one arm, swinging in a stomach-lurching arc. The camera, also in free-fall, follows her. She fires her other hook, using the momentum to run horizontally along the glass windows of a building before launching herself towards a waiting aircraft. High-octane, dizzying POV, fast-paced action.
