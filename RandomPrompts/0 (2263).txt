A woman with long, wavy blonde hair wearing a brown mink fur coat and black leather pants, walking along a beach with a blue ocean in the background. She is holding a black leather handbag in her left hand and wearing black high-heeled boots. The beach is sunny and clear, with a palm tree in the foreground. The woman is the main focus of the image, with the ocean stretching out behind her. The image is taken from a low angle, looking down on her.
