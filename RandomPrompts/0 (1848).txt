In the image, a person is standing in front of a shower wall that has a black and silver mosaic tile pattern. The individual is wearing a black thong and has blonde hair. They are facing away from the camera, with their back towards us. Their arms are raised above their head, as if they are drying off or preparing to step into the water. The lighting in the room appears to be coming from one side, casting a shadow on the right side of the person's body. There is no visible text in the image.
