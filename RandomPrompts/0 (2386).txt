Medium shot of a woman in her early 30s with long, raven hair, wearing a black velvet blazer, standing in the lobby of an old theater—faded posters hang on walls, and a single chandelier casts a soft glow. Camera slowly pushes in as she pulls a small, folded playbill from her bag, her fingers brushing over a handwritten note—her expression shifts from curious to haunted. Close-up on her face as a tear catches the chandelier’s light, shimmering softly—the lobby blurs into a warm blur of gold and crimson, suspending her in a moment of quiet revelation.
