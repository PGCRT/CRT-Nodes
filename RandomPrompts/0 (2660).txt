(Fantasy/Awe) An old woman with kind, wrinkled eyes sits on a simple wooden chair on a dark stage, knitting. The camera is a medium shot. | She pulls on her yarn, but instead of wool, she is pulling a shimmering, silver thread of pure starlight from a tear in the fabric of the dark backdrop behind her. | The camera dollies back to reveal she has knitted a vast, sprawling tapestry of the Milky Way galaxy, which now covers the entire stage floor in a glowing, celestial map. Mythical, gentle, cosmically beautiful.
