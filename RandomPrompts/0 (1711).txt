A photograph of two women standing against a yellow wall in a narrow alley. The woman on the left is wearing a white dress with a floral pattern and has long blonde hair. She is holding a white cloth in her hands and appears to be looking up at the man on the right. The man is standing behind her, holding a red and white bag. The alley has a glass door with a red "HET" sign on it. The lighting is dim, casting shadows on the women's faces. The image is high quality and has a watermark in the bottom right corner.
