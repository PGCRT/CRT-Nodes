A young woman with long dark hair and fair skin stands confidently in the center of the frame, wearing a black oversized sweater with a white t-shirt underneath, black tights, and black boots. She is holding a brown jacket in her left hand, and her right hand is resting on her hip. The background features a large stone building with a metal lattice window, and a white bicycle parked next to her. The lighting is bright and natural, casting shadows on the ground. The woman has a relaxed and confident expression.
