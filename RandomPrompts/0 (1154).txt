(Psychological Thriller) A man sits in a soundproof, white room, undergoing a hearing test. He has headphones on. A doctor on the other side of a glass pane gestures. The man signals he hears nothing. The camera slowly zooms in on the man's face, which is growing increasingly terrified, as we, the audience, begin to hear a faint, insidious whispering that is seemingly coming from inside his own head. Minimalist, high-tension, auditory horror.
