(Fantasy/Awe) An explorer in a dense, alien jungle discovers a clearing. In the center is a 'river' not of water, but of countless, shimmering, ethereal souls flowing slowly towards a massive, glowing tree. The souls drift up from the river and are absorbed into the tree's glowing leaves. A spiritual, visually stunning scene of reincarnation.
