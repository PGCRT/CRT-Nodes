Wide shot of Hattie Mae sitting on a stool in the dead center of a dusty, moonlit crossroads at midnight, playing a slow, gut-wrenching blues on her battered guitar. | A tall, impossibly handsome man in a pristine white suit appears from the shadows, his smile charming but his eyes completely black; he lets her finish her song. | He offers her everything—fame, fortune, youth—in exchange for her guitar. Hattie Mae looks at her worn instrument, then back at the demon, and with a wry, tired smile, she says, "This old thing? Honey, you can't afford what this guitar cost me."
