(Action/Post-Apocalyptic) A high-speed chase sequence with two ramshackle war-rigs through a vast, salt-flat desert. The camera is mounted on a swooping gyrocopter, capturing the brutal, Mad Max-style action from impossible angles as raiders leap between the vehicles against a backdrop of a blood-red sunset. Gritty, high-octane, visceral.
