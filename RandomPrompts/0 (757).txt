(Culinary/Fantasy) A master sushi chef, old and blind, stands at his station. He does not use a knife. He makes a series of intricate, flowing hand gestures over a whole fish. In response, the fish deconstructs itself, its flesh separating into perfect, shimmering slices that arrange themselves beautifully on the plate. Magical, precise, serene.
