Dr. Elara Vance appears in a shimmer of distorted air in a warm, sunlit 1990s kitchen, a look of profound sadness on her face as she observes her younger self doing homework. | She waits for her younger self to leave the room, then quickly and quietly moves a set of car keys from a hook by the door to a bowl on the counterâ€”the small change she came back to make. | The moment she moves the keys, the warm sunlight outside the window instantly blinks out, replaced by a blood-red sky and the sound of distant sirens; the familiar house around her flickers and decays into rusted ruins, and her face contorts in horror as she realizes her small fix has created a catastrophic paradox.
