19. Photorealistic image set in a Celestial/Cosmic realm, radiating a mood of cosmic awe and serene detachment. The subject is a celestial being with an androgynous frame, crystalline-textured skin, opalescent hair in flowing waves, and bejeweled eyes with a high-fashion editorial look. The artistic style is inspired by Terrence Malickâ€™s ethereal aesthetic, with a high-key bright and airy palette. Shot on IMAX MSM 9802 (70mm) with a wide-angle 18mm lens, featuring deep depth of field and subtle lens flares. Aerial shot, static, framing the being floating among stars, their expression tranquil with a faint smile.
