Medium shot of a woman in her early 30s with cropped raven hair, wearing a worn leather jacket, standing inside a derelict observatory under a shattered glass dome—stars pierce the night sky above, casting faint light on rusted machinery. Camera dollies in as she brushes dust from an old star chart on a tilted table, her fingers lingering on a constellation drawn in faded ink—her jaw tightens, eyes flickering with buried memory. Close-up on her face as she lifts her gaze to the open sky, starlight illuminating a single tear tracing her cheek—the telescope’s shadow looms behind her, and the world softens into a celestial blur of indigo and silver.
