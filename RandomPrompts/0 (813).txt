A cinematic shot of a woman named 'Sol', the last priestess of a sun cult, standing on top of a pyramid in a city shrouded by a permanent, artificial eclipse. | She holds up a small, crystal prism, angling it to catch the faint light of the corona. | The prism focuses the weak light into a single, intensely bright beam that she directs at a massive glyph on the pyramid's peak. The glyph ignites with fiery light, and a wave of energy shoots into the sky, beginning to tear a hole in the artificial darkness.
