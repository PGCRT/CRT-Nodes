A gritty medium shot of Lyra, a young woman with her face half-covered by a scavenger's mask, siphoning gasoline from a rusted-out car in the sun-scorched ruins of a vast desert city. The air shimmers with heat, and the only sound is the wind whistling through skeletal skyscrapers. | She freezes, hearing the distant, rhythmic chittering of a 'Scrabbler' pack, a sound that makes her blood run cold. With practiced urgency, she abandons the fuel can and silently climbs a rickety fire escape, her movements fluid and desperate. | From her precarious perch five stories up, she watches in horror as a swarm of fast-moving, insectoid monstrosities floods the street below, their mandibles clicking as they swarm over the car she was just at, and she realizes she has climbed directly into the path of their nest on the rooftop above.
