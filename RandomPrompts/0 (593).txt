31. Photorealistic image set in a Clockpunk workshop, evoking a mood of inventive curiosity and mechanical precision. The subject is a clockmaker with a lean and wiry body, rough weathered skin with calloused hands, ash brown hair in a messy bun, and no makeup with a cleft chin. The artistic style is inspired by graphic novel (Frank Millerâ€™s Sin City), with a high-contrast monochrome palette. Shot on Blackmagic URSA Mini Pro with a vintage Russian Helios-44 50mm lens, featuring swirly bokeh and soft vignetting. Eye-level medium shot, static, capturing the clockmaker assembling a intricate gear mechanism, their expression focused with a furrowed brow.
