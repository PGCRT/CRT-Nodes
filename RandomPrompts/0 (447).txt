In a sterile, white laboratory, Dr. Aris Thorne watches a time-lapse of a cell culture treated with her experimental regeneration serum. | The cells are not just regenerating; they are evolving, forming complex, multi-cellular structures at an impossible rate. Her face is a mixture of scientific awe and dawning apprehension. | She leaves the lab for the night. The camera remains, and the time-lapse continues, showing the cell culture growing beyond its petri dish, forming a single, large, primitive eye that swivels to look directly at the lab's security camera.
