(Culinary Horror) An extreme close-up, macro shot of a Michelin-star chef's hands using tweezers to place the final element on a deconstructed dessert. The element is a perfect, glistening sugar cube. As he places it, the camera racks focus to the inside of the translucent cube, revealing a tiny, perfectly formed human skeleton trapped within, its mouth agape in a silent scream. Stark, clinical lighting, minimalist horror, deeply unsettling.
