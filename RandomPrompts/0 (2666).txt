(Fantasy/Craft) A slow, macro-lens orbital shot around the hands of a celestial watchmaker. He is not assembling a watch, but a miniature solar system. He uses tweezers to place a tiny, pulsating star at the center, and with a soft breath, he sets the planets spinning in their perfect orbits within a crystal sphere. Awe-inspiring detail, cosmic creation, quiet grandeur.
