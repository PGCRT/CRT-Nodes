A slow, tense pan through a lavish, empty opera house. The only person there is a woman named Cassandra, a world-class soprano, standing on the center of the stage, her eyes closed. | She begins to sing, her voice pure and powerful, but she uses no words. She is singing a lost, ancient melody designed to reveal hidden truths. | As her voice reaches its crescendo, the ornate, gilded decorations on the walls of the opera house begin to flake away, revealing the walls are not plaster, but are made of a strange, dark, non-reflective material covered in glowing, alien sigils that pulse in time with her song.
