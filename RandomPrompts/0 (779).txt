(Finale/Hope) A single, continuous shot begins on a child's tear falling. It hits the ground and becomes a seed. The seed sprouts into a tree. The camera flies up the trunk, through the branches, into the sky. The tree grows until it pierces the clouds, its highest branches covered in stars. The camera settles on the child, now an old man, sleeping peacefully at the base of his world-tree. A life story told in a single, magical shot.
