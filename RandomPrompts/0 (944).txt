A wide shot of a woman named Val, a "sky-fisher," standing on a floating platform high in the clouds of a gas giant planet. | She casts a long, glowing line down into the thick, swirling atmosphere below. | After a long wait, her line goes taut.

She finally hauls it over the edge: a magnificent, shimmering creature that looks like a manta ray with wings made of pure lightning.
