Photograph of three young women walking down a street in a European city. The woman on the left has long brown hair and is wearing a black tank top and ripped blue jeans, while the woman in the middle has a white t-shirt and black pants, and is carrying a yellow bag. The two women on the right have blonde hair and are wearing black t- shirts and a gray skirt. The street is bustling with people, and the buildings in the background are tall and narrow. The lighting is bright and natural, casting shadows on the women's faces. The image is high quality and has a watermark in the bottom left corner.
