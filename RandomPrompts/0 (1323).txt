A young, idealistic paranormal investigator, Maya, is exploring a haunted shipwreck with her EMF meter. | The meter leads her to the captain's cabin, where she finds a perfectly preserved, beautiful music box. | She opens the music box, and a lovely, tinkling melody plays. The EMF meter goes silent. The ghost wasn't haunting the ship; it was trapped in the box, and she has just released it into the room with her.
