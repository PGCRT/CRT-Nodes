13. Photorealistic image set in the Industrial Revolution, evoking a mood of gritty toil and quiet resilience. The subject is a factory worker with a heavy-set body, rough weathered skin with calloused hands, chestnut brown hair in a messy bun, and no makeup with laugh lines. The artistic style is inspired by Italian Neorealism, with a sepia-toned palette. Shot on Arriflex 16SR with a wide-angle 18mm lens, featuring visible dust and scratches and heavy vignetting. Eye-level medium shot, static, capturing the worker at a steam-powered machine, their expression tired with a furrowed brow.
