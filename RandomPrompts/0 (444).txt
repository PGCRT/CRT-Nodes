(Sci-Fi/Horror) The POV from a rescue robot sifting through the wreckage of a crashed starship. Its heat sensors are active. It scans the debris, finding cold, dead bodies. Then, it pans over a pile of rubble, and the heat signature shows a perfectly-formed human, glowing white-hot with heat, but completely unburnt and unmoving. It's not a survivor; it's a lure. Tense, suspenseful, sci-fi horror.
