Wide shot of Echo sitting alone in the middle of a vast, cracked, and completely barren dust bowl under a hazy, brown sky, a picture of desolation. | She lifts her makeshift instrument and begins to play a slow, deeply melancholic, and beautiful melody that seems to hang in the dead air. | The camera pushes in on a patch of cracked earth at her feet; as she plays, a single, vibrant green sprout miraculously pushes its way through the dry ground, unfurling its leaves in response to the sound, and a tear of pure hope carves a clean line through the grime on her cheek.
