(Horror) A POV shot from a child on a swing set. With each swing forward, the world is normal and sunny. With each swing back, the world is dark, dilapidated, and a tall, slender, faceless figure in the distance gets slightly closer. The swinging gets higher and faster, the cuts between light and dark more rapid, the figure closer and closer with each oscillation. Found footage, building dread, simple concept with terrifying execution.
