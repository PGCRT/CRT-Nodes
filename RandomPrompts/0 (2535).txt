Medium shot of a woman in her early 30s with vibrant teal hair in a loose braid, wearing a denim overall dress, standing before a sprawling mural in a narrow urban alley—streetlights cast a soft glow, and the mural’s colors pulse with life. Camera slowly dollies in as she reaches into her bag and pulls out a small sketchbook, flipping to a page with a matching drawing—her lips curve into a faint smile, eyes shimmering with recognition. Close-up on her face as she traces the mural with her fingers, a tear catching the neon glow—the alley blurs into a vibrant tapestry of color and shadow, suspending her in a moment of quiet connection.
