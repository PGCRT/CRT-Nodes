(Action) A single, unbroken ten-minute tracking shot (a "oner") follows a female bodyguard protecting a diplomat through a crowded marketplace when an assassination attempt erupts. The camera is an invisible dance partner, weaving through chaos, following her as she neutralizes threats with brutal efficiency, navigates panicked crowds, and improvises weapons, all while shielding her target. Gritty, realistic, highly choreographed, 'Children of Men' style immersion.
