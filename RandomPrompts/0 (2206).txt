40. Photorealistic image set in the Gothic Victorian era, radiating a mood of eerie mystery and suppressed desire. The subject is a widow with a soft and rounded body, pale porcelain skin with rosacea, jet black hair in a Gibson tuck, and gothic makeup with deep vampy lipstick. The artistic style is inspired by Tim Burtonâ€™s gothic fantasy, with a high-contrast monochrome palette. Shot on Arriflex 435 (35mm) with a Petzval 85mm lens, featuring swirly bokeh and heavy vignetting. Over-the-shoulder shot, static, showing the widow standing in a foggy graveyard, holding a black rose, her expression mournful with a single tear.
