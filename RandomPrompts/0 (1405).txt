A beautiful, wide shot of a woman, a "star-whisperer," lying in a field on a remote moon, looking up at a sky filled with alien constellations. | She begins to hum a complex, tonal melody, and the stars above begin to shift and brighten in response, rearranging themselves into new patterns. | She is not just watching the stars; she is communicating with them, but this time, a vast portion of the sky goes completely dark, a section of stars blinking out in unisonâ€”a clear, terrifying, and silent response from a consciousness far greater than she ever imagined.
