Photo of a young woman with long brown hair, wearing a blue and white polka-dot dress, standing on a zebra crossing in a busy city street. She is wearing black sneakers and has a brown leather crossbody bag slung over her shoulder. The background shows a bustling cityscape with people walking and standing, as well as a yellow sign that says "West 33rd Street." The lighting is bright and natural, casting shadows on the woman's body. The image has a watermark in the bottom left corner.
