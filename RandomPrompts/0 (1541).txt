7. Photorealistic image set in a Steampunk city, evoking a mood of adventurous curiosity and mechanical wonder. The subject is an inventor with a compact and muscular body, olive-toned skin with calloused hands, jet black hair in a pompadour, and no makeup with prominent dimples. The artistic style is inspired by graphic novel (Frank Millerâ€™s Sin City), with a high-contrast monochrome palette. Shot on Blackmagic URSA Mini Pro with a vintage Russian Helios-44 50mm lens, featuring swirly bokeh and soft vignetting. Eye-level medium shot, static, framing the inventor tinkering with a brass gadget at a cluttered workbench, their expression focused with a furrowed brow.
