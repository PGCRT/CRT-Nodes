In a tranquil Japanese garden, a young woman named Akiko, an apprentice to a master sword-smith, fails for the hundredth time to fold a piece of steel correctly. Frustrated, she cries. | A single tear falls onto the hot steel, and instead of evaporating, it sizzles and is absorbed into the metal, which now glows with a soft, pearlescent light. | She picks up her hammer and strikes the glowing metal, and this time it folds perfectly, the steel ringing with a pure, musical note, as if her sorrow has perfected the blade.
