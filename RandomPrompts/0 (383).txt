A young woman with fair skin and blonde hair, wearing a black and white patterned dress and brown sandals, standing on a crosswalk in a city street. She is wearing blue sunglasses and carrying a turquoise handbag. Behind her, two other women, one in a blue skirt and the other in a white shirt and black shorts, are walking. The background shows a brick building and a few pedestrians walking on the street. The woman in the foreground is the main focus of the image, with the other two women walking behind her.
