A curvy woman with long, curly raven hair flowing freely down her back in wild, voluminous waves, wearing a sheer, pastoral linen dress with floral embroidery that reveals her toned midriff and natural breasts, her smooth, pale skin glowing under warm, golden sunlight, posing gracefully in a rolling meadow with a blurred background of wildflowers, grazing sheep, and a distant barn, her sultry green eyes and neutral expression exuding quiet confidence, a delicate daisy crown resting in her hair, the scene enriched by the sweet scent of clover, the gentle bleating of lambs, and the soft rustle of grass, creating a photorealistic pastoral portrait that captures her serene allure and the idyllic, sunlit atmosphere of a peaceful countryside.
