(Art-House Horror) A woman finds an old videotape. She plays it. The screen shows her exact room, from the exact same perspective she is currently watching it from. The video is live. She waves at the camera, and the figure on the TV waves back. Then, the figure on the TV stops waving and just stares, while the real woman's arm is still raised, a look of dawning horror on her face. Uncanny, reality-bending, single-location dread.
