The image presents a woman standing on what appears to be a sandy beach, facing away from the camera. She is wearing denim shorts that are frayed at the edges and have a hole in her backside. Over her shoulder, she has draped a denim jacket with visible stitching and a design on it. The jacket's sleeves are also frayed, matching the shorts' frayed look. Her hair is long and wavy, cascading over her shoulders.

Her skin tone is fair, and there is a tattoo visible on her upper arm near the top of her head. The background shows an open space with some greenery and trees, suggesting a natural outdoor setting. There is no other person or significant detail in the immediate vicinity except for this solitary figure against the backdrop of the beach environment.
