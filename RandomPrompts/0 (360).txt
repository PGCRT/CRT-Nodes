Medium shot of a woman in her early 30s with short, raven hair, wearing a burgundy cardigan, standing in a dimly lit bookstore corner at night—shelves tower around her, and a single lamp casts a warm glow. Camera slowly pushes in as she pulls a small, leather-bound book from a shelf, her fingers brushing over a handwritten dedication—her eyes widen, lips parting with recognition. Close-up on her face as a tear catches the lamplight, shimmering softly—the shelves blur into a warm blur of amber and brown, framing her in a moment of quiet revelation.
