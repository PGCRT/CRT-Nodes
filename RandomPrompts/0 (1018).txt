In the image, a woman is lying on her stomach in the ocean waves. She has long hair that flows down her back and she's wearing a white top with thin straps. The water around her is splashing up around her as she lies there, creating a dynamic scene. There are rocks visible in the background of the photo, adding to the natural setting. The lighting suggests it might be late afternoon or early evening, given the softness of the light.
