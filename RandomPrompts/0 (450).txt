(Historical/Epic) A dynamic drone shot flies over the Great Wall of China during its construction. Thousands of workers move like ants. The shot then seamlessly fast-forwards through time. Dynasties rise and fall, the wall's material changes from earth to stone, seasons flash by in seconds, and armies clash at its base, until we arrive at the modern day with tourists walking along the same stretch of wall. Awe-inspiring time-lapse, historical grandeur.
