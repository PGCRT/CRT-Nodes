8. Cinematic image set in the 1980s Neon Noir, conveying a mood of brooding intensity and urban isolation. The subject is a detective with a broad-chested body, rough weathered skin with faint scars, ash brown hair in a quiff, and smudged “day after” eyeliner with a sharp jawline. The artistic style is inspired by David Lynch’s surrealism, with a neon palette of pinks and blues. Shot on Arriflex 16SR (16mm) with a wide-angle 18mm lens, featuring light leaks and chromatic aberration. Over-the-shoulder shot, static, showing the detective staring into a rainy cityscape from a diner window, their expression weary with a clenched jaw.
