(Surreal/Gothic) In a vast, ornate, and dusty ballroom, a lone vampire waltzes gracefully. Her partner is not a person, but her own impossibly sharp and distinct shadow, which moves independently on the floor, leading her in the dance under a massive, cobweb-covered chandelier. Melancholic, romantic horror, Tim Burton-esque aesthetic.
