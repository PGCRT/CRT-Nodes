Medium shot of a woman in her early 30s with short, silver hair, wearing a charcoal wool coat, standing on a city bridge at dawn—mist rises from the river below, and the skyline glows faintly pink. Camera slowly tracks in as she opens a small, velvet pouch, revealing a single pearl earring—her breath catches, fingers trembling as she holds it to the light. Close-up on her face as a tear rolls down her cheek, catching the soft morning glow—the bridge and city blur into a serene haze of pink and gray, framing her in a moment of poignant reflection.
