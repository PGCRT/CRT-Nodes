(Historical/Mythology) A Roman legionary, lost and dying of thirst in the Egyptian desert, stumbles and falls. As he looks up, the heat haze shimmers and resolves not into a mirage, but into the towering form of Anubis, the jackal-headed god, who solemnly offers him a sip of water from an earthen jar before leading his soul into the afterlife. Myth made real, somber, epic.
