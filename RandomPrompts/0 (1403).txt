A young woman with fair skin and dark hair, wearing a white, fluffy coat and a gray, knitted sweater. She is standing in the middle of a busy city street, holding a yellow cup with a green straw. The background is blurred, but it appears to be an urban setting with other people and vehicles. The woman has a serious expression and is looking to the side. The image is taken from a low angle, looking up at the woman.
