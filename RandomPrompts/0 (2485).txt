Medium shot of a woman in her late 20s with fiery red hair cascading over her shoulders, wearing a heavy wool sweater, standing near a small bonfire on a cliffside at night—waves crash far below, and the flames cast flickering shadows across jagged rocks. Camera slowly tracks in as she pulls a folded photograph from her pocket, her hands shaking as she unfolds it to reveal a faded image—her expression hardens, eyes glistening with resolve. Close-up on her face as she tosses the photo into the fire, the flames reflecting in her tear-filled eyes—the sea and stars blur into a dark, radiant void, isolating her in a moment of fierce release.
