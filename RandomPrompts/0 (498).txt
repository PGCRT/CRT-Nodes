(Horror) A family watches their home movies from the 1990s on an old TV. The footage is grainy and cheerful. In the background of a child's birthday party scene, the ghostly, pale face of a woman slowly fades into view in a doorway, watches for a moment, and then fades away. The family on the couch doesn't notice, but the audience does. Subtle, chilling, found-footage horror.
