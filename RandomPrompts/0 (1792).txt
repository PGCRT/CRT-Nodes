In a world recovering from a magical apocalypse, a woman named Elara scavenges in the "spell-scarred" ruins of a city. | She finds a single, perfectly intact, pre-apocalypse music box. | She winds it up, and it plays a simple, beautiful nursery rhyme. The pure, uncorrupted magic of the simple tune causes the twisted, magical landscape around her to recede, creating a small, perfect circle of green grass and clean air in the middle of the devastation.
