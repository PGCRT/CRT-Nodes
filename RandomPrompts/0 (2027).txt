(Sci-Fi/Western) A low-angle, wide shot of a lone, rusted automaton in a dusty poncho standing silhouetted against the twin suns of a desert planet. The camera slowly pushes in, revealing he's meticulously tending to a single, impossible cerulean blue rose growing from the red sand. A quiet, melancholic scene, blending Sergio Leone's style with the loneliness of science fiction.
