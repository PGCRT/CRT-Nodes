(Thriller) A woman is hiding under a bed. The camera is under there with her, sharing her claustrophobic point of view. We see the heavy, slow-moving boots of someone searching the room. The boots stop right in front of the bed. They pause. Then, they slowly begin to float upwards off the floor, as if their owner is being lifted into the air. Paranormal horror, extreme tension, sound design is key.
