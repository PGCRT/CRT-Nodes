(Action/Thriller) A spy hangs from the landing gear of a massive cargo plane as it takes off. A vertigo-inducing shot looks straight down, the runway shrinking rapidly below. He pulls himself up, the camera orbiting around him as he plants a device, the wind roaring, the city lights a glittering carpet thousands of feet beneath him. Mission Impossible-style tension, high-stakes, realistic CGI.
