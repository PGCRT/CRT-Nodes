Medium shot of a woman in her late 20s with long, auburn hair, wearing a heavy green scarf, standing on a misty river bridge at dawn—water flows below, and golden light pierces the fog. Camera slowly arcs around her as she opens a small, leather pouch, revealing a tiny glass vial—her expression shifts from calm to awe, eyes glistening with wonder. Close-up on her face as she holds the vial, a tear catching the sunlight—the bridge blurs into a serene haze of green and gold, suspending her in a moment of ethereal discovery.
