(Psychological Thriller) A man sits in a coffee shop. Everyone around him is frozen in time, mid-sip, mid-laugh. He is the only one moving. He walks around, confused. He taps a frozen woman on the shoulder. She slowly turns her head, her eyes wide with terror, and whispers, "You can see us?" revealing he's a ghost and the frozen people are the living. A perspective-flip twist.
