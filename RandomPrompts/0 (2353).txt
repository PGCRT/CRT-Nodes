A gritty, handheld shot captures Kaelen, a resourceful survivor in a dust-choked, post-apocalyptic city, as she barters with a shadowy merchant in a makeshift market. She trades precious water for a single, strange, pre-apocalypse compass that doesn't point north, its needle spinning erratically. | Later, while hiding from a patrol of masked fanatics, she clutches the compass, and the needle suddenly stops spinning and points directly at a specific, blank brick wall in the alleyway. Her brow furrows in confusion and suspicion. | Driven by a desperate hunch, she pushes against the wall. A section of brick grinds inwards, revealing a hidden, perfectly preserved, and fully-stocked underground fallout shelter from the old world. The air that wafts out is clean and cool, and the lights inside flicker on, revealing a paradise she never thought could exist.
