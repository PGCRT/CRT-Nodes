Medium shot of a woman in her late 20s with short, dark blonde hair, wearing a faded denim jacket, standing on a coastal dune path at sunset—sea grass sways, and the sky burns with hues of orange and pink. Camera slowly tracks in as she pulls a small, polished stone from her pocket, her fingers tracing its smooth surface—her lips part, a flicker of nostalgia crossing her face. Close-up on her profile as a tear catches the sunset’s glow, reflecting the dunes—the path blurs into a warm wash of gold and blue, framing her in a moment of tender memory.
