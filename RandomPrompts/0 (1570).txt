Two women standing on a set of stairs in a grand hall, both with long brown hair and fair skin. The woman on the left is wearing a long, dark red coat and is holding a green bag with the word "DREAMS" written on it. She is also wearing a dark blue coat with a white bunny design on the front. The background shows a Christmas tree decorated with lights, and a no smoking sign is visible on the right side of the image. The women are smiling and appear to be engaged in a friendly conversation. The image is taken from a low angle, looking up at the women.
