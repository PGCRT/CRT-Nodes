Medium shot of a woman in her early 30s with short, platinum hair, wearing a red trench coat, standing in a neon-lit train station at night—trains rumble faintly, and reflections dance on the platform. Camera slowly dollies in as she pulls a small, crumpled ticket from her pocket, her fingers tracing its faded print—her brow furrows, eyes shimmering with hope. Close-up on her face as a tear catches the neon glow, reflecting vibrant blues and pinks—the station blurs into a vibrant blur of light and shadow, framing her in a moment of silent anticipation.
