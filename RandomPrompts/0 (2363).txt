Medium shot of a woman in her late 20s with long, dark brown hair in a loose braid, wearing a wool shawl, standing among ancient cliffside ruins at dusk—crumbling stone arches frame a fiery horizon, and a cool breeze stirs her hair. Camera slowly arcs around her as she kneels beside a cracked stone tablet, her fingers brushing over faint carvings—her expression shifts from curiosity to awe, eyes glistening with discovery. Close-up on her eyes as they reflect the sunset’s glow, a tear tracing her cheek—the ruins blur into a radiant tapestry of orange and shadow, suspending her in a moment of timeless wonder.
