(Sci-Fi) A scientist in a clean-room lab observes a levitating, shimmering cube of pure energy. She cautiously reaches out a gloved hand. | As her finger touches the cube's surface, the camera crash-zooms into her eye, which now reflects the entirety of the Big Bang happening in a split second. | She pulls her hand back, her face a mask of sublime, terrifying comprehension. The camera pulls back to show that the stars are now visible through her skin, her body a living container for a new universe. Cosmic horror meets scientific discovery.
