(Historical/Myth) A Viking longship sails not on water, but through the shimmering, aurora-filled branches of Yggdrasil, the world tree. The camera swoops and soars around the ship like a bird, capturing the Viking crew looking up in awe at cosmic serpents and star-eagles nesting in the cosmic branches. Psychedelic, mythical, visually stunning, God of War (2018) aesthetic.
