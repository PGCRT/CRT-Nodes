A wide shot of a massive, ancient library where the books are not paper, but are stored as shimmering, crystalline memory shards. A young acolyte named Elara carefully polishes one of the shards. | She accidentally drops a shard, and it cracks. Instead of breaking, it projects a fragmented, holographic memory into the room: a terrifying vision of a handsome, silver-haired king executing his own queen. | The Head Librarian, a stern old woman, rushes over, but not with anger. She looks at the scene with deep sorrow and says, "It is a memory we were meant to forget. Now that you have seen it, the echo of his treason will hunt you." A shadowy, armored figure materializes at the end of the aisle.
