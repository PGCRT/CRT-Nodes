(Surreal/Noir) A detective walks into a bar where patrons pay for drinks not with money, but with memories, which the bartender extracts and bottles. The detective orders a drink and offers up a painful memory. A visual effect shows a shimmering, ghostly scene being pulled from his temple and funneled into a glass. Melancholy, high-concept noir.
