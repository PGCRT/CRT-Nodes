A blonde woman with fair skin and a slender build, wearing a white, short-sleeved shirt with a red, abstract print. She is sitting on a wicker chair, holding a pen in her right hand and wearing a pair of sunglasses. The background is dark with a hint of greenery, suggesting an outdoor setting. The lighting is soft and natural, casting gentle shadows. The woman has a relaxed, confident expression, with her lips slightly parted. The image has a watermark in the bottom right corner.
