(Surreal/Tragedy) An overhead crane shot shows a car crash on a highway. The scene is frozen in time, a tableau of twisted metal and shattered glass. Paramedics, also frozen, are in mid-stride. The camera slowly pushes in on a single, airborne shard of glass, and reflected on its surface is the entire, happy life of the driver flashing by in a split second. Poetic, heartbreaking, slow-motion.
