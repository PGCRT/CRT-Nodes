A young woman with long blonde hair, wearing a white sleeveless top and a brown skirt, walking down a street lined with people. She is wearing black ankle boots and has a smile on her face. The street is lined with tables and chairs, and there are potted plants with colorful flowers on them. The background shows a building with a wooden facade and trees. The image is slightly blurred, with a watermark in the bottom right corner.
