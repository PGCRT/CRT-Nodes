A woman with long black hair and red sunglasses is walking down the street. She is wearing a black leather jacket, a tight black dress, and high heels. The background features a brick wall with a blue sign that reads "Bristol". The woman is holding a phone in one hand and a black handbag in the other. The street is empty, with no other people or objects in sight. The lighting is bright and natural, casting shadows on the ground. The image has a high-quality, professional feel.
