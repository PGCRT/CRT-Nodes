(Fantasy) A druid stands before a dying, withered forest. He places his hands on the ground, and a wave of green, vibrant life radiates out from him. A time-lapse sequence shows the entire forest being reborn in seconds: dead trees sprout new leaves, flowers bloom, and dried riverbeds fill with water. A powerful display of life magic.
