In a sleek, minimalist apartment, a woman named "Jane Doe," a retired assassin, is watering her orchids. Her life is now one of peaceful anonymity. | She pricks her finger on a thorn, and a drop of blood falls on the floor. | The drop of blood sizzles and reveals a hidden, laser-activated targeting system on her from a building across the street. Her peaceful expression vanishes, replaced by the cold, lethal focus of her past life.
