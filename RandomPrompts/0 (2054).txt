Two women, one in a white dress and the other in a red dress, both with long blonde hair, standing on a sidewalk in front of a store. The woman in the red dress is holding a grey Louis Vuitton handbag and appears to be talking on her phone, while the other woman is sitting on a wicker chair. The background shows a busy street with people and a yellow umbrella. The scene is set in a French Quarter.
