Two older women standing next to each other in a parking lot, both with white hair. The woman on the left is wearing a black hat, a black top with gold embroidery, and black pants, with a black handbag and a necklace. She is smiling and appears to be engaged in conversation with the other woman. The background shows a city street with parked cars and trees. The image is high quality and has a watermark in the bottom right corner.
