(Thriller) A child is playing with alphabet blocks on the floor. Their parents are arguing in the background, their words muffled and indistinct. The camera is a top-down shot focused on the blocks. The child, seemingly oblivious, calmly spells out the phrase "HE IS IN THE CLOSET" with the blocks. High-tension, dramatic irony.
