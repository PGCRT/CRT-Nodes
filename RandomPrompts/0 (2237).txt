Medium shot of a woman in her late 20s with shoulder-length chestnut hair, wearing a faded olive-green jacket, standing inside an abandoned train car overgrown with vines—dim sunlight filters through cracked windows, casting dappled shadows across rusted seats. Camera slowly tracks in as she runs her fingers along a dusty armrest, pausing to pick up a small, tarnished locket tangled in the vines—her expression softens, eyes flickering with distant memory. Close-up on her face as she opens the locket to reveal a tiny, faded photograph, a tear catching the golden light—the train car blurs into a soft haze of green and amber, isolating her in a moment of quiet longing.
