Medium shot of a woman in her late 20s with long, chestnut hair, wearing a moss-green cloak, standing on a misty hilltop at dawn—rolling hills vanish into the fog, and golden light breaks through the haze. Camera slowly arcs around her as she opens a small, leather pouch, revealing a tiny glass vial—her expression shifts from calm to awe, eyes glistening with wonder. Close-up on her eyes as they reflect the vial’s faint glow, a tear catching the sunlight—the hilltop blurs into a serene haze of green and gold, framing her in a moment of ethereal revelation.
