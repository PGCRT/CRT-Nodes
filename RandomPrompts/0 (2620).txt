An extreme wide shot shows a lone figure, the gunslinger Islabel, standing in the middle of a vast, cracked desert under a blood-red sun. She is facing down a "dust devil," a small tornado, but this one has a strange, unnatural, shimmering quality. | As the dust devil gets closer, it resolves into a swirling vortex of screaming, ghostly faces and grasping handsâ€”a "soulstorm." Islabel doesn't run. She stands her ground, her hand hovering over the custom, silver-inlaid pistol on her hip. | She draws her pistol with impossible speed, but instead of firing a bullet, she fires a single, concentrated piece of her own defiant will. The "bullet" of pure energy hits the soulstorm, and instead of dispersing it, it pacifies it, the screaming faces turning calm as they are finally laid to rest, leaving Islabel standing alone in the now-silent desert.
