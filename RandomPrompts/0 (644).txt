A slow, creeping dolly shot follows Sister Elena, a young, devout nun, as she carries a lantern through the cold, dark catacombs beneath her ancient convent. She is searching for a text mentioned in a heretical manuscript she found. | She finds a hidden, sealed chamber, and after breaking the ancient mortar seal, she enters. The chamber contains not books, but a single, ornate, silver sarcophagus covered in symbols that are both holy and deeply unsettling. | She hears a faint scratching from inside the sarcophagus. Against all reason, she lifts the heavy lid. Inside is not a body, but a beautiful, pale woman with long black hair and her eyes sealed shut with wax, who takes a shuddering, deep breath of fresh air for the first time in centuries and whispers, "Thank you for waking me. Now, tell me, has the Church of my enemies fallen yet?"
