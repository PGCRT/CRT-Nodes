The image features a young woman standing on a tennis court, poised as if ready to serve. She is dressed in a blue two-piece athletic outfit with white trim and a zipper detail at the front. The top piece of clothing has a scoop neckline and the bottom piece appears to be a one-piece swimsuit or bodysuit, revealing her midriff. In her right hand, she holds a bright yellow tennis ball, while her left hand is adjusting the zipper of her top. Her hair is long and brown, styled straight, and it falls over her shoulders.

The background shows part of the tennis net and the green surface of the court, which is typical for such sports facilities. There are no other people visible in this frame, suggesting that the focus is solely on the woman and her actions. The lighting suggests an outdoor setting, likely during daytime given the natural light.
