(Fantasy/Epic) An extreme wide shot shows a single warrior standing on a cliff edge, their cape billowing in the wind. A colossal shadow falls over them. The camera tilts up, and up, and up, revealing a sky-whale, a creature the size of a mountain, its skin a mosaic of living constellations and nebulae, swimming silently through the clouds above. Awe-inspiring scale, cinematic fantasy, high dynamic range.
