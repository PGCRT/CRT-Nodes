A poised woman with long, wavy auburn hair flowing freely down her back in soft, baroque-inspired waves, wearing a sheer, gold-embroidered gown with intricate lace that clings to her voluptuous breasts and slender waist, her flawless, tanned skin illuminated by soft, candlelit glow, standing in a lavish opera house with a blurred background of velvet curtains, gilded balconies, and flickering chandeliers, her calm brown eyes and subtle smile evoking elegance and intrigue, a delicate pearl ring on her finger catching the light, the scene enriched by the faint scent of perfume, the soft hum of an orchestra tuning, and the rustle of silk gowns, creating a photorealistic baroque portrait that captures her timeless beauty and the opulent, dramatic atmosphere of a grand, historical performance hall.
