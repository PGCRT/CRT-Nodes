A woman with long, wavy brown hair, wearing a blue tweed jacket with a white collar, and sunglasses. She is talking on her phone while holding a green tissue box in her right hand. The background is blurred, but it appears to be an outdoor setting with a building in the distance. The woman has a confident expression and is wearing a gold watch on her left wrist. The image is high quality and has a watermark in the bottom right corner.
