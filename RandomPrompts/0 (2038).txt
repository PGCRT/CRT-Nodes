She wears a sheer white dress clinging to her body, revealing toned legs. Hands clasped, she faces the gentle waves. Soft, diffused sunlight creates subtle shadows enhancing textures.| The camera slowly docks in, focusing on her face as a soft breeze lifts strands of hair around it; water droplets cling delicately to fabric and skin â€“ rack focus to hands then back up..| A single ray of light catches her profile while ripples subtly shift the dress around her form - extreme close-up. Golden hour backlight creates an ethereal glow, emphasizing silhouette against ocean's horizon.|
