9. Hyperrealistic image set in a Solarpunk utopia, radiating a mood of serene optimism and natural harmony. The subject is a gardener with a lean dancer’s build, dewy luminous skin with vitiligo patterns, forest green hair in a halo braid, and natural “no-makeup” makeup with high cheekbones. The artistic style is inspired by Ghibli-inspired anime, with a pastel palette. Shot on Canon C500 Mark II with a macro 100mm lens, featuring dreamy bokeh and soft-focus filter. Profile shot, static, capturing the gardener tending to vibrant plants in a lush greenhouse, their expression peaceful with a gentle smile.
