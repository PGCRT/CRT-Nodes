realtime motion, dynamic movements  A high-resolution photograph opens on a medium shot of a young woman with light skin and platinum blonde hair cascading over her shoulders, framed by dark eyelashes. She wears a slightly wrinkled black hooded cloak against a gradient black background; soft diffused lighting highlights her features. Her expression is introspective. | The camera gently *dollys in* as she slowly reaches out and touches the fabric of her cloak, revealing intricate silver embroidery barely visible in the dim light. A subtle breeze rustles her hair around her face, creating delicate shadows.| Close-up on her striking green eyes; a faint smile appears. She lifts an old, worn photograph, its edges softened with age as she gazes at it intently before slowly lowering it back into her cloak, returning to her contemplative posture in the darkness.
