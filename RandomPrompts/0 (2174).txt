(Art-House/Fantasy) A sculptor carves a statue of a woman from a massive block of marble. He works with manic intensity. As he carves the curve of her hip, his own side aches. When he chisels her eyes, his own vision blurs. The final shot shows a perfect, life-like statue of the woman, and the sculptor collapsed beside it, now a rough, un-carved block of human-shaped marble. A magical transference, symbolic, bittersweet.
