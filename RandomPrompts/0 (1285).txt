Medium shot of a woman in her late 20s with tousled, auburn hair, wearing a faded blue sweater, standing in an abandoned train depot at dusk—rusted tracks vanish into the horizon, and golden light spills through broken windows. Camera slowly pushes in as she pulls a small, folded map from her pocket, her fingers tracing a marked route—her expression shifts from curious to aching, a breeze stirring dust around her. Close-up on her eyes as they well with tears, the sunset reflecting in her pupils—the depot fades into a warm blur of amber and shadow, isolating her in a moment of quiet yearning.
