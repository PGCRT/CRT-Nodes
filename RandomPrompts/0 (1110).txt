Photo of two women walking down a set of stairs in a park, both wearing glasses and holding books. The woman on the left has long blonde hair and is wearing a black t-shirt and black pants. She has a tattoo on her left arm and is holding a white book in her hand. She is also wearing a white off-the-shoulder dress and has long black hair. The background shows a crowd of people sitting on the stairs and some walking. The image is slightly blurry and has a watermark in the bottom right corner.
