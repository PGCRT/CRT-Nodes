(Psychological Horror) A man is at home, trying to hang a picture. He hammers a nail into the wall. He misses, hitting his thumb. He yells in pain, but the sound that comes out of his mouth is a dog's bark. He tries to speak again, and a bird chirps. The camera is a tight, suffocating close-up on his face, contorted in confusion and terror as a symphony of animal sounds erupts from his throat. Body horror of the mind, high anxiety.
