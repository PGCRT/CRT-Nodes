In a steampunk London, a female airship captain, Beatrice "Bea" Shaw, is pursued by sky pirates. | Her ship's main engine is damaged and venting steam. | She climbs out onto the exterior of the speeding airship, makes her way to the engine, and with a massive wrench and sheer nerve, she manually reroutes the steam pressure, causing the ship to lurch violently and shake off the pirates.
