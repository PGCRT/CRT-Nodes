Cinematic wide shot of a lone woman, a gunslinger named Islabel, with a long duster coat and a low-slung pistol, walking into a dusty, eerily silent Wild West town. Every window is shuttered, every door is closed. | She enters the saloon, which is empty except for a single, ornate music box playing a haunting, discordant tune on the bar. She cautiously approaches it. | She reaches out to touch the music box, and the instant her finger makes contact, the music stops, and every door and shutter in the entire town slams open at once, revealing dozens of townspeople with blank, white eyes, all turning to stare directly at her.
