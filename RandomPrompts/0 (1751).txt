A sweeping, low-angle shot captures Dr. Elara Vance, a disgraced but brilliant temporal physicist in her 40s, as she stands within the cavernous, humming core of her illicitly built time machine, the air crackling with ozone and flashing with arcs of blue static electricity. She wears a scorched, utilitarian jumpsuit and her face, illuminated by the pulsing core, is a mask of desperate, grim determination as she makes the final adjustments on a complex, sparking console. | The camera pushes in dramatically on her hand as she slams a large, red lever downwards; the entire room is flooded with a blinding white light and a deafening roar, and we see a rapid-fire montage of historical images—pyramids being built, Roman legions marching, knights clashing—flashing across her face, her eyes squeezed shut against the temporal vortex. | Complete, sudden silence. The light subsides. Elara opens her eyes, her breathing ragged, and finds herself not in the past, but standing in the exact same spot in her lab, which is now ancient, covered in thick cobwebs and dust, with a century of decay around her. Through a grimy window, she sees a sky filled with unfamiliar constellations, realizing she didn't just travel in time, she traveled to a dead, alternate future of her own making.
