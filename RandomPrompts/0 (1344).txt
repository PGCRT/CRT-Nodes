33. Hyperrealistic image set in a Dark Fantasy castle, radiating a mood of eerie enchantment and quiet dread. The subject is a necromancer with a statuesque and athletic body, pale ivory skin with faint scars, deep burgundy hair in a Dutch braid crown, and gothic makeup with deep vampy lipstick. The artistic style is inspired by Tim Burtonâ€™s gothic fantasy, with a low-key dark and shadowy palette. Shot on RED Komodo with a Petzval 85mm lens, featuring swirly bokeh and heavy vignetting. Low-angle wide shot, static, capturing the necromancer summoning a spectral figure, their expression fierce with glowing eyes.
