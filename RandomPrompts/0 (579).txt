(Thriller) A woman sits alone in a sterile, white interrogation room, a single bare bulb overhead. The camera is a tight, claustrophobic close-up on her face, which is calm and emotionless. | The camera begins an impossibly slow dolly-out, revealing the 'interrogator' is her exact doppelgänger, smiling faintly. | The doppelgänger gently places a steaming teacup on the table, and the original woman's eyes widen in sheer, unadulterated terror. High contrast, black and white, psychological thriller.
