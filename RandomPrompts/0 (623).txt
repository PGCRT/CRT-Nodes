41. Cinematic image set in a Mythological Olympus, conveying a mood of divine majesty and ethereal grace. The subject is a god with an hourglass figure, iridescent skin with a golden sheen, platinum blonde hair in flowing waves, and bejeweled eyes with a high-fashion editorial look. The artistic style is inspired by Romanticism (Turner), with a high-key bright and airy palette. Shot on IMAX MSM 9802 with a wide-angle 18mm lens, featuring deep depth of field and subtle lens flares. Aerial shot, static, framing the god standing on a marble throne, holding a lightning bolt, their expression radiant with a serene gaze.
