A radiant woman with long, cascading chestnut hair flowing in glossy, voluminous curls past her waist, wearing a sheer, sapphire-blue gown with intricate silver embroidery that clings to her curvy figure, accentuating her full, natural breasts and toned hips, her flawless, porcelain skin shimmering with a dewy glow under soft, golden-hour sunlight filtering through wispy clouds, standing gracefully on a windswept cliffside overlooking a vast, blurred ocean background with frothy turquoise waves crashing against jagged rocks below, her piercing green eyes sparkling with serene intensity, lips parted in a subtle smile, a delicate gold necklace with a sapphire pendant resting against her collarbone, a faint sea breeze carrying the scent of salt and wildflowers, her poised stance exuding timeless elegance and tranquility, the scene enriched by the distant cry of seagulls and the rhythmic crash of waves, creating a breathtaking, photorealistic coastal portrait that captures her ethereal beauty and the vibrant, serene atmosphere of the seascape at dusk.
