A poised woman with long, wavy auburn hair flowing freely down her back in soft, fiery waves, wearing a sheer white dress with intricate pearl beadwork that clings to her voluptuous breasts and slender waist, her flawless, tanned skin illuminated by soft, indoor lighting, standing in a luxurious ballroom with a blurred background of polished marble floors, ornate chandeliers, and plush velvet curtains, her calm brown eyes and subtle smile evoking elegance and intimacy, a delicate gold ring on her finger catching the light, a faint mole on her neck adding charm, the scene enriched by the faint scent of roses, the warm glow of chandelier light, and the soft hum of classical music from a distant orchestra, creating a photorealistic portrait of timeless beauty and refined sophistication in a grand, opulent setting.
