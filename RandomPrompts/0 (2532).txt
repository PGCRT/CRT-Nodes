Medium shot of a woman in her late 20s with shoulder-length chestnut hair, wearing a faded gray hoodie, standing on the deck of an abandoned observatory at midnight—stars blaze above, and rusted railings creak in the wind. Camera slowly tracks in as she pulls a crumpled star map from her pocket, her fingers tracing a constellation—her expression shifts from curious to wistful, eyes glistening faintly. Close-up on her face as a tear catches the starlight, reflecting a distant galaxy—the deck blurs into a shimmering veil of indigo and silver, isolating her in a moment of quiet longing.
