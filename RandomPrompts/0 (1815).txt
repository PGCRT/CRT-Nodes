(Sci-Fi/Social Commentary) A sweeping drone shot glides over a crowded, neon-lit 'Memory Market' where vendors sell glowing orbs of bottled experiences. The camera lands on a young woman who buys a cheap, flickering orb. A split-screen effect shows her blissful face as she uses a viewer, while the other side shows her POV: a glitchy, corrupted, low-resolution fake memory, full of digital artifacts and pop-up ads for "Premium Memories." Blade Runner aesthetic, bittersweet social commentary.
