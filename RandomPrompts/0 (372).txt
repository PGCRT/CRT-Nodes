A cunning woman with sleek, jet-black hair styled in a loose braid adorned with silver chains, wearing a tattered, black lace gown that emphasizes her curvaceous figure, her pale skin glowing under flickering, crimson torchlight, carving runes into a wooden staff | tossing glowing embers into a brazier in a shadowy crypt with a blurred background of ancient sarcophagi, glowing sigils, and swirling mist, her intense red eyes narrowed in focus, a delicate onyx amulet resting against her collarbone, the air thick with the scent of damp stone and incense, her mystical movements exuding menace, the scene alive with the whisper of spirits, the toll of distant bells, and the crackle of flames, creating a candid, photorealistic gothic fantasy video that captures her haunting allure and the eerie, mystical atmosphere of a forsaken tomb at midnight.
