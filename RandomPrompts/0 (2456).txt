Medium shot of a woman in her late 20s with wavy, honey-blonde hair, wearing a faded denim shirt, standing in a windswept prairie at sunset—tall grasses sway around her, and the sky burns with hues of orange and pink. Camera slowly pushes in as she opens a small wooden box, revealing a bundle of dried wildflowers tied with twine—her lips tremble, eyes softening with a pang of memory. Close-up on her profile as she lifts a flower to her face, a tear catching the fading sunlight—the prairie blurs into a warm wash of gold and crimson, isolating her in a moment of tender nostalgia.
