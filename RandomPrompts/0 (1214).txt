Medium shot of a woman in her early 30s with curly, auburn hair under a knit beanie, wearing a burgundy parka, standing in a snow-dusted village square at twilight—lanterns glow faintly, casting shadows on cobblestones. Camera slowly arcs around her as she opens a small, wooden box, revealing a delicate silver bell—her expression softens, eyes shimmering with recognition. Close-up on her face as she rings the bell, its soft chime echoing, a tear freezing on her cheek—the square blurs into a serene wash of white and gold, isolating her in a moment of quiet reverence.
