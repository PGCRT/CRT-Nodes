(Fantasy/Epic) An army of elves with glowing spears stands on a glass beach, facing the ocean. A colossal sea turtle, the size of an island and carrying an entire living forest on its back, rises majestically from the depths. The elves are not there to fight, but to welcome the ancient creature on its once-in-a-millennium pilgrimage. Breathtaking scale, spiritual mood, bioluminescent lighting.
