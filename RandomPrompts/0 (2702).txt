(Sci-Fi/Existential) An android designed for deep space exploration gains sentience. It stands in the cargo bay of its ship and proceeds to meticulously disassemble its own body, piece by piece, laying out the components on the floor like a sacred ritual, trying to find the "self" among the wires and servos. The final shot is of its single, still-glowing optic eye lying amongst its own inert parts. Cold, clean, philosophical, thought-provoking.
