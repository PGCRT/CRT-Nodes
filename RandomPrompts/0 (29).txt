A woman with long brown hair and a tattoo on her left arm, wearing a black sleeveless top and black pants, walking down the street at night. She is holding a blue and white coffee cup in one hand and a black and white patterned bag in the other. The background is blurred, but it appears to be an outdoor setting with a dimly lit environment. The woman has a confident expression and is looking directly at the camera.
