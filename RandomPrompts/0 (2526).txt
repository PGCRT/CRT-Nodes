A tense close-up on the face of Maya, a fighter pilot in a futuristic aerial dogfight. Her cockpit is rattling, alarms are blaring, and enemy lasers streak past. | Her targeting system is damaged. She closes her eyes, ignoring the technology, and syncs her breathing with the hum of her ship's engines, trying to "feel" where the enemy is. | Her eyes snap open. She yanks the control stick hard left, firing blindly into empty space. A moment later, a cloaked enemy ship shimmers into view directly in the path of her plasma bolts and explodes. She has learned to see without her eyes.
