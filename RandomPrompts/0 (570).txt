(Action) A vertigo-inducing shot from the tip of a wrecking ball as it swings towards an old building. Just before impact, a parkour expert leaps from the ball, using its momentum to launch himself through a window, rolling into a perfect landing inside as the building begins to collapse around him. High-impact, kinetic, perfectly timed stunt.
