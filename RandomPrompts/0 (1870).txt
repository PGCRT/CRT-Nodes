(Surreal/Romance) A man and a woman are on a first date in an aquarium. As they connect, the glass of the tanks dissolves away, and the fish, turtles, and sharks all swim freely through the air around them, gracefully navigating between the tables and other patrons as if the entire building were underwater. Dreamlike, romantic, visually stunning.
