(Sci-Fi/Horror) A tracking shot follows a lone astronaut in a clunky, retro-futuristic spacesuit sprinting down a derelict space station corridor, flickering emergency lights casting long, dancing shadows. The camera suddenly whips around 180 degrees to reveal the corridor behind him is warping and dissolving into a glitchy, pixelated void that is rapidly gaining on him. Hyper-realistic, 8K, found-footage style, intense panic.
