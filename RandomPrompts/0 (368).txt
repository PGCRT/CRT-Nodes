A woman with fair skin and dark brown hair wearing a red and white striped dress. She is standing in front of a large white tent at an outdoor market, with a crowd of people in the background. The woman has a surprised expression on her face, and she is holding her hair with one hand. The scene is slightly blurred, with trees and a clear blue sky visible. There is a watermark in the bottom right corner of the image.
