A wide, atmospheric shot shows a woman named Mara, the sole inhabitant of a research outpost on a planet with a perpetual, violet-hued twilight. She is collecting geological samples from a field of strange, crystalline trees. | She notices all the crystalline trees are "leaning" slightly in one direction, as if drawn by a silent, invisible force. Her instruments show no gravitational anomalies. | She follows the direction of the lean for miles, over a ridge, and what she finds makes her drop her sample kit in shock: the entire forest is leaning away in terror from a single, small, perfectly silent, black sphere hovering a foot off the ground, that seems to absorb all light and sound around it.
