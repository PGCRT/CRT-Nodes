(Surreal/Art-house) A man in a bowler hat walks through a desert where it rains grand pianos. They fall from the sky in slow motion, crashing silently into the sand and shattering into clouds of dust and splintered wood. The man navigates the strange landscape without reaction, holding a red umbrella. Magritte-inspired, deeply symbolic, strange beauty.
