Medium shot of a woman in her late 20s with curly chestnut hair, wearing a vintage crimson dress, standing at the threshold of an overgrown greenhouse—golden hour light spills through cracked glass panes, casting fractured beams across the mossy floor | Camera slowly pushes in as she steps inside, her fingers trailing along dust-covered leaves—she pauses before a forgotten table where a single blooming rose stands in a cracked porcelain vase, her face softening with distant recognition | Close-up on her profile as she leans in to inhale the flower—sunlight flares through the petals, illuminating the fine dust in the air; her eyes flutter closed and a wistful smile forms, caught in the glow of memory
