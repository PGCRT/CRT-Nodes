18. Hyperrealistic image set in the American Revolution, evoking a mood of fervent hope and grim determination. The subject is a revolutionary with a compact and muscular body, tanned golden skin with dirt, chestnut brown hair in a messy bun, and no makeup with a crooked nose. The artistic style is inspired by gritty realism, with a muted earth-toned palette. Shot on Arriflex 16SR (16mm) with a wide-angle 18mm lens, featuring heavy film grain and chromatic aberration. Ground-level shot, static, framing the revolutionary hiding behind a barricade, clutching a flintlock pistol, their expression tense with wide eyes.
