(Fantasy/Thriller) An assassin who can manipulate shadows is infiltrating a brightly lit castle. A tracking shot follows him as he 'jumps' from one small shadow to another—from a suit of armor, to a banner, to a passing guard—moving impossibly fast and unseen across the polished floor. High-concept stealth, dynamic lighting.
