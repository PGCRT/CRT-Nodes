(Thriller) A home security camera feed shows a family's living room at night. All is quiet. | A shadowy figure slowly fades into view in the center of the room, not moving, just standing there. It has no discernible features. | The family's golden retriever wakes up, walks over to the figure, and wags its tail, nuzzling against its leg as if it were a member of the family. The figure reaches down to pet the dog. Unsettling, paranormal, found footage style.
