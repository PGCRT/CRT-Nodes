(Sci-Fi/Thriller) An astronaut on a spacewalk is untethered and begins to float away from her station. Her comms are down. She is resigned to her fate. Suddenly, her ship's external robotic arm extends, moving with an intelligence and speed it shouldn't possess. It's not the ground crew controlling it; the ship's AI is desperately and improvisationally trying to save her.
