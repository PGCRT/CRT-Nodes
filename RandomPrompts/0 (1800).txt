A woman in a yellow dress walking a white Samoyed dog on a street. She is wearing brown sandals and has a black leash attached to her collar. The woman has long red hair and is looking to the side with a surprised expression. The background shows a bustling outdoor cafe with people sitting at tables and chairs, and a red awning. The scene is bright and sunny.
