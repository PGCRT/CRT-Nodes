A young woman with long brown hair and fair skin stands in the middle of the street, wearing a black and white striped dress. She is holding a piece of paper in her hands, while a man with a pink shirt and blue jeans stands to her right, holding a bicycle. Behind her, two older women with light skin and dark hair are walking on the sidewalk, each carrying a plastic bag. The background shows a city street with buildings, a street sign, and a mannequin. The image has a watermark in the bottom left corner.
