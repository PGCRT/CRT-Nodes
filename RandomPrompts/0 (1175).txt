A photograph of two young women walking in a grand train station. The woman on the left is wearing a brown coat with a fur lining, a yellow scarf around her neck, and black sunglasses. She has fair skin and is looking directly at the camera with a confident expression. The man on the right is also wearing a red hooded puffer jacket with a black chain strap. The background shows a bustling market with other people walking and carrying bags. The sky is overcast and the overall mood is casual and relaxed. The image is high quality and has a watermark in the bottom right corner.
