Medium shot of a woman in her late 20s with sleek, platinum hair, wearing a black leather jacket, standing on a fire escape at midnight—city lights pulse below, and a cool breeze stirs her hair. Camera slowly dollies in as she pulls a small, folded note from her pocket, her fingers tracing the ink—her brow furrows, a flicker of hope crossing her face. Close-up on her eyes as they shimmer with tears, reflecting the city’s glow—the skyline blurs into a sparkling veil of silver and blue, framing her in a moment of quiet anticipation.
