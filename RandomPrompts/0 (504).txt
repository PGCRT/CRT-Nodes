A radiant woman with long, cascading platinum blonde hair flowing in shimmering, cyberpunk strands past her waist, wearing a sleek, neon-pink bodysuit with glowing circuit patterns that clings to her curvy figure, accentuating her full breasts and toned hips, her smooth, porcelain skin glowing under flickering, blue-hued neon lights, obliviously tinkering with a holographic gadget in a cluttered cyberworkshop with a blurred background of sparking wires, floating data screens, and a neon-lit cityscape visible through a grimy window, her piercing blue eyes focused intently on her work, a delicate digital implant on her temple glinting faintly, the air thick with the scent of solder and ozone, her nimble fingers moving with precision, the scene alive with the hum of machinery, the crackle of static, and distant city noise, creating a candid, photorealistic cyberpunk portrait that captures her natural focus and the vibrant, chaotic atmosphere of a futuristic tech hub at midnight.
