Medium shot of a woman in her early 30s with short, raven hair, wearing a faded denim jacket, standing inside a deserted train carriage at twilight—vines creep through broken windows, and soft light filters through the dust. Camera slowly tracks in as she pulls a small, folded letter from her pocket, her fingers trembling as she unfolds it—her lips part, eyes softening with memory. Close-up on her face as a tear rolls down her cheek, catching the twilight’s glow—the carriage blurs into a dreamy wash of green and amber, isolating her in a moment of quiet sorrow.
