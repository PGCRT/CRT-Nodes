Medium shot of a woman in her early 30s with short, jet-black hair, wearing a red leather jacket, standing in a neon-lit arcade alley at night—game machines hum, casting vibrant reflections on the pavement. Camera slowly dollies in as she pulls a small, crumpled arcade token from her pocket, her fingers tracing its worn edge—her brow furrows, eyes flickering with nostalgia. Close-up on her face as a tear catches the neon glow, reflecting pinks and blues—the alley blurs into a vibrant blur of light and shadow, isolating her in a moment of silent yearning.
