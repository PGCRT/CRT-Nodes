A radiant woman with long, flowing chestnut hair cascading in soft, voluminous curls over her shoulders, wearing a sheer, intricately embroidered lavender dress that clings delicately to her curvy figure, accentuating her full, natural breasts and slender waist, her flawless, porcelain skin glowing with a dewy sheen under warm, golden-hour sunlight filtering through scattered clouds, standing confidently on a windswept cliffside overlooking a vast, blurred ocean background with frothy turquoise waves crashing against jagged rocks, her serene blue eyes sparkling with quiet intensity, lips slightly parted in a gentle smile, a subtle mole on her cheek adding character, exuding timeless elegance and tranquility in a breathtaking, photorealistic coastal scene framed by a vibrant sunset sky casting soft shadows across her toned physique.
