(Surreal/Noir) A detective is walking down an endless, repeating hotel corridor. He opens a door marked '237', enters, and finds himself at the beginning of the same corridor. He tries again. Same result. | He stops, defeated, and looks at his own reflection in a polished fire extinguisher case. His reflection gives him a pitying look, then turns and walks away down its own reflected hallway, leaving him behind. Psychological labyrinth, Lynchian dread, disorienting.
