(Sci-Fi) A massive, city-sized 'generation ship' arrives at its destination planet after a thousand-year journey. The viewscreen shows a lush, green, perfect world. The ship's captain, an old woman, gives the order to open the main viewport. As the shields retract, the camera pulls back from her tear-streaked, joyful face to reveal the entire population of the ship is just her, all alone, the last survivor. Heartbreaking twist, profound loneliness.
