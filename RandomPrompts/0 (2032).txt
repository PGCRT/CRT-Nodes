A cunning woman with short, choppy platinum hair streaked with electric blue, wearing a sleek, black bodysuit with glowing red circuit patterns that hugs her wiry frame, her pale skin shimmering under flickering, neon-green lights, hacking a holographic terminal | dodging a sudden security drone in a high-tech server room with a blurred background of humming servers, blinking lights, and a city skyline through a tinted window, her sharp blue eyes narrowed in focus, a thin digital implant glinting on her temple, the air thick with the scent of ozone and heated metal, her agile movements exuding precision, the scene alive with the buzz of electronics, the whir of drones, and distant alarms, creating a candid, photorealistic cyberpunk video that captures her sharp intellect and the tense, futuristic atmosphere of a corporate stronghold at midnight.
