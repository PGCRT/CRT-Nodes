(Historical/Art) A dynamic, motion-control shot follows the hand of Michelangelo as he paints the Sistine Chapel ceiling. The shot seamlessly transitions from his hand to the brush, to the wet plaster, to the face of God he is creating, then pulls back to show the epic scale of the work, condensing days of labor into a single, fluid, awe-inspiring shot.
