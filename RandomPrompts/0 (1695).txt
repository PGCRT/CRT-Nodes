(Surreal/Horror) A man is walking through a crowded subway station. He glances at his reflection in a passing train window. | His reflection stops walking, turns, and presses its hands against the glass from the inside, its face a mask of silent screaming, pleading with him. | The train pulls away, but the screaming reflection remains behind, imprinted on the air, before shattering like glass. Everyday setting turned nightmarish, high shock value.
