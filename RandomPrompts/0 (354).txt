Medium shot of a woman in her late 20s with wavy, honey-blonde hair, wearing a burgundy scarf, standing by a park fountain at dusk—water ripples softly, and city lights begin to glow. Camera slowly pushes in as she opens a small, velvet box, revealing a single pearl ring—her expression shifts from calm to wistful, eyes glistening faintly. Close-up on her eyes as they well with tears, reflecting the fountain’s glow—the park blurs into a warm blur of blue and gold, isolating her in a moment of silent longing.
