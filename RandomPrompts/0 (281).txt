Medium shot of a woman in her early 30s with curly, chestnut hair, wearing a cream linen dress, standing in a deserted rooftop garden at dawn—potted plants sway in the breeze, and the city skyline glows faintly pink. Camera slowly dollies in as she kneels beside a small clay pot, her fingers brushing over a budding rose—her face softens, a faint smile breaking through her sorrow. Close-up on her eyes as they shimmer with tears, the sunrise catching the petals—the skyline blurs into a warm haze of pink and gray, framing her in a moment of tender renewal.
