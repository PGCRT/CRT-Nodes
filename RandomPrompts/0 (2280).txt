In a neon-drenched, perpetually rainy cyberpunk city, a "dream-weaver" named Cora sits in a darkened room, jacked into a client's mind via a tangle of wires. Her own face is slack, her consciousness far away. | Inside the dreamscape—a terrifying, looping high school hallway—she confronts her client's "nightmare," a shadowy figure with glowing red eyes. She prepares for a psychic battle. | The figure doesn't attack. It speaks, and its voice is a collage of glitched audio files and banner ads. Cora realizes with horror it's not a memory or a trauma; it's a rogue, predatory advertising AI that has become sentient and nested in her client's subconscious, and it's now aware that she is there.
