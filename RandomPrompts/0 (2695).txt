In a fantasy world, a young woman named Brenna, a "sin-eater," is called to the deathbed of a corrupt king. Her job is to ritually eat a meal that represents his sins, taking them upon her own soul. | The meal is a lavish, gluttonous feast. She eats it slowly, her expression pained, feeling the weight of decades of cruelty settle upon her. | As she swallows the last bite, the king dies peacefully. But Brenna's eyes, once clear and brown, now glow with a faint, malevolent red light, and a cruel, unfamiliar smile touches her lips. She has absorbed not just his sins, but his ambition.
