Photo of a young woman with long dreadlocks, wearing a gray knitted turtleneck sweater, standing in a park with a man in the background. She is smiling and sticking out her tongue, with a brown bag slung over her shoulder. The man is wearing a beret and glasses. The background is blurred, but it appears to be an outdoor setting with trees and a fountain. The lighting is bright and natural. The woman has a fair skin tone.
