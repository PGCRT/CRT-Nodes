Medium shot of a woman in her late 20s with short, raven hair, wearing a faded denim jacket, standing on a coastal boardwalk at twilight—waves lap gently, and a lavender sky casts a soft glow. Camera slowly tracks in as she pulls a small, sealed bottle from her pocket, her fingers brushing over a corked note—her breath catches, eyes shimmering with hope. Close-up on her profile as she uncorks the bottle, a tear catching the twilight’s glow—the boardwalk blurs into a serene wash of blue and purple, isolating her in a moment of quiet anticipation.
