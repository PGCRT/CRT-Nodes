(Surreal/Art) An artist in a paint-splattered studio makes the final brushstroke on a hyper-realistic portrait of an old man. The camera pushes in on the painting. | As the brush lifts, the painted man's eyes slowly blink, filled with ancient sadness. | The camera rack focuses from the painting to the artist, who has now aged 50 years, her own face now identical to the portrait, a single tear running down her wrinkled cheek. Magical realism, dramatic lighting, heartbreaking.
