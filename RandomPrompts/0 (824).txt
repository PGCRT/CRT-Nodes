A young woman with light skin and long black hair, wearing a white helmet with a green visor, and a white crop top that reveals her midriff. She is riding a green and black electric scooter with the word "Lime" written on the side. The background shows a bustling outdoor market with people walking and playing. The woman is positioned in the center of the image, with the background slightly out of focus. The lighting is bright and natural, casting soft shadows. The image is high quality and has a watermark in the bottom right corner.
