35. Cinematic image set in a Space Opera, conveying a mood of cosmic adventure and quiet determination. The subject is a pilot with a broad-chested body, tanned golden skin with faint scars, silver hair in a sleek high ponytail, and no makeup with a sharp jawline. The artistic style is inspired by Terrence Malickâ€™s ethereal aesthetic, with a moonlit blues and silvers palette. Shot on IMAX MSM 9802 with a wide-angle 18mm lens, featuring deep depth of field and subtle lens flares. Aerial shot, static, framing the pilot in a cockpit, staring at a distant starfield, their expression focused with narrowed eyes.
