3. Hyperrealistic image set in the High Middle Ages, radiating a mood of chivalric honor and quiet resolve. The subject is a knight with a broad-chested body, tanned golden skin with faint scars, chestnut brown hair in a short crop, and no makeup with a sharp jawline. The artistic style is inspired by Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, with a warm golden hour palette. Shot on Panavision Panaflex System 65 with a Leica Summilux-C 85mm lens, featuring creamy bokeh and shallow depth of field. Eye-level medium shot, static, capturing the knight kneeling before a king, sword in hand, their expression solemn with downcast eyes.
