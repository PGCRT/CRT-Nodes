12. Hyperrealistic image set in the Great Depression Era, evoking a mood of weary resilience and quiet despair. The subject is a farmer with a heavy-set body, rough weathered skin with sunspots, salt and pepper hair in a bowl cut, and no makeup with laugh lines. The artistic style is inspired by Italian Neorealism, with a sepia-toned palette. Shot on Arriflex 435 (35mm) with a spherical 50mm lens, featuring visible dust and scratches and heavy vignetting. Ground-level shot, static, framing the farmer leaning on a pitchfork in a barren field, his expression tired with a furrowed brow.
