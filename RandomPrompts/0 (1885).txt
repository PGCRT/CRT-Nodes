A woman named Mara is a "dream-weaver," literally entering people's minds to cure their nightmares. She is in a patient's dream, a dark, stormy sea. | The source of the nightmare, a massive, shadowy leviathan, rises from the depths. | Instead of fighting it, Mara begins to hum a gentle lullaby. The storm calms, and the leviathan shrinks, transforming into a small, frightened child, which she then embraces.
