A medium shot of Dr. Imani Adebayo, a xeno-archaeologist, standing in a shimmering, alien ruin on Mars. The air is thin, and the sky is a pale pink. Her expression is one of scholarly wonder. | She discovers a chamber where the walls are covered in murals depicting the alien race. They are tall, elegant beings. The final mural shows them all bowing before a single, massive tree that seems to be made of light. | In the center of the chamber, she finds a single, fossilized seed. As a scientist, she should catalogue it. Instead, driven by an unexplainable impulse, she cracks the helmet of her suit, exposing the seed to the thin Martian atmosphere. The seed instantly sprouts, and the entire ruin begins to vibrate with a deep, resonant hum as the planet's dormant terraforming systems begin to awaken around her.
