Medium shot of a woman in her early 30s with silver-streaked auburn hair, wearing a moss-green cloak, standing in a misty forest clearing at dawn—shafts of sunlight pierce through towering pines, illuminating dew-kissed ferns. Camera slowly arcs around her as she kneels beside a small wooden box half-buried in the earth, her hands carefully brushing away dirt—her expression shifts from curiosity to quiet awe as she lifts the lid to reveal a tiny glass vial glowing faintly. Close-up on her face as she holds the vial to the light, her eyes reflecting its soft radiance—the forest blurs into a serene tapestry of green and gold, enveloping her in a moment of ethereal discovery.
