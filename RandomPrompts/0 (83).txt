2. Cinematic image set in the Viking Age, conveying a mood of fierce determination and raw survival. The subject is a warrior with a broad-shouldered and powerful body, rough weathered skin with jagged scars, ash blonde hair in Viking braids, and no makeup with a sharp jawline. The artistic style is inspired by gritty realism, with a desaturated cool-toned palette. Shot on RED V-Raptor with a wide-angle 18mm lens, featuring heavy film grain and chromatic aberration. Low-angle wide shot, static, capturing the warrior standing on a stormy cliff, gripping a bloodied axe, his expression grim with narrowed eyes and pursed lips.
