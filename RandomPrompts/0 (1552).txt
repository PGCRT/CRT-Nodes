Medium shot, Sable, disguised as a timid art historian, is granted access to the vast, cold, and strangely empty mansion of an infamous recluse. | She finds her target, a handsome man, in a library, but he doesn't respond to her; she notices his movements are too perfect, too smooth.

She realizes her mark isn't a human, but a profoundly lonely android.
