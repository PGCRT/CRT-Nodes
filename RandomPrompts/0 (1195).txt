A curvy woman with long, curly raven hair flowing freely down her back in wild, voluminous waves, wearing a sheer, romantic lace blouse that reveals her toned midriff and natural breasts, her smooth, pale skin glowing under soft, golden candlelight, obliviously arranging a bouquet of roses at a rustic table in a cozy cottage with a blurred background of wooden beams, open windows, and fluttering lace curtains, her sultry green eyes focused on her flowers, a delicate silver locket catching the light, the scene enriched by the sweet scent of roses, the soft chirping of crickets, and the rustle of a gentle breeze, her tender arranging exuding natural care, creating a candid, photorealistic romantic portrait that captures her serene allure and the warm, intimate atmosphere of a countryside evening.
