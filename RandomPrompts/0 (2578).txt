A photograph of a woman with a slender build and fair skin, wearing a black leather jacket and red sunglasses, standing in the middle of a busy street. She has a black choker around her neck and a black handbag on her left shoulder. The woman is looking over her shoulder with a contemplative expression, while a man with a black hooded jacket is standing to her right, looking back at her. The background is blurred, but it appears to be a busy city street with people and buildings. The lighting is soft and natural, highlighting the woman's features. The image has a high-quality, professional feel.
