(Sci-Fi/Existential) The last man on Earth sits in a barren room. On a table is a complex alien device covered in buttons. A sign reads "DO NOT PRESS." He has been staring at it for years. | With a look of final, weary resignation, he presses the largest button. | The camera rapidly pulls back, out of the room, out of the atmosphere, past the moon, past the solar system, revealing our entire universe is just one of many glowing marbles on a vast, un-understandable alien child's playroom floor. Mind-bending, cosmic scale, ultimate shock value.
