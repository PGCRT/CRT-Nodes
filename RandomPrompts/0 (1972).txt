(Action/Espionage) A spy is being chased across the rooftops of Venice during Carnival. The camera is a frenetic, shaky handheld shot. He leaps across a canal, landing in the middle of a masquerade ball on a floating barge. He grabs a mask and blends in, the camera spinning to capture the chaos and opulent costumes as he tries to spot his pursuer among the masked dancers. High-energy, visually rich, disorienting.
