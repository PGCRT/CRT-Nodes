(Surreal) A tracking shot follows a child's red balloon as it escapes their hand and floats up into a city sky. It passes skyscrapers and flies into the clouds. Above the cloud layer, it joins millions of other red balloons, all tied to the strings of a colossal, sleeping child, the size of a mountain, who is floating in the stratosphere. Inverting scale, dream logic, awe-inspiring visual.
