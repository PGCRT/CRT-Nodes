(Historical/Discovery) An archeologist in the 1920s brushes dust from a stone sarcophagus in an Egyptian tomb. She finds a hidden seam. | Using a crowbar, she pries it open; instead of a mummy, the sarcophagus is filled with intricate, whirring clockwork machinery and glowing vacuum tubes, a mechanical heart pulsing at its center. | A close-up on her face shows not fear, but obsessive, manic glee as she realizes she's found impossible ancient technology. Indiana Jones meets H.R. Giger, torchlight, dusty atmosphere.
