A wide shot shows the last human, a woman named Alani, standing on a cliff overlooking a lush, new, alien world, her crashed colony ship smoking behind her. She is utterly alone. | She finds a strange, crystal-like cave system. Inside, the walls are covered with complex carvings left by a long-vanished civilization. | She touches one of the carvings, and it lights up. A wave of information floods her mindâ€”the entire history, language, and knowledge of the extinct alien race, downloaded directly into her brain. She is no longer just the last human; she is the living library of a dead civilization.
