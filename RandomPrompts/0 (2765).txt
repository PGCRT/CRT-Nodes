(Sci-Fi) A time traveler arrives in a pristine, white, empty city. He finds a single terminal. On it is a message: "Humanity has evolved. We have uploaded our consciousnesses to the network. This is all that is left." He touches the screen, and for a second, his body glitches, becoming a constellation of light, giving him a glimpse of the ecstatic digital afterlife he can never join. Profound loneliness, high-concept sci-fi.
