(Historical/Action) A Vaudeville stage, 1920s. A magician attempts his "bullet catch" trick. The camera follows the bullet in extreme slow motion as it leaves the gun. The magician's face shifts from performance confidence to genuine terror as he realizes the bullet is real. | In the same slow-motion shot, his beautiful assistant throws a single playing card from off-stage. | The card slices the bullet perfectly in two just before it hits him. Shocking twist, theatrical lighting.
