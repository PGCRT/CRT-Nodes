A stunning wide shot reveals Lyra, a lithe elven scout, standing on a cliff edge overlooking a valley shrouded in an unnatural, roiling purple mist. Her silver hair is whipped by the wind, and her expression is one of grim duty as she stares down at the blighted land her people have sent her to investigate. | She rappels down into the valley, landing silently in a forest where the trees are twisted and the ground is covered in strange, pulsating fungi. She kneels, touching a finger to a viscous purple pool on the ground, and a wave of psychic pain and sorrow assaults her mind, making her recoil with a sharp cry. | She pushes through the psychic agony and follows the trail of corruption to its source: a clearing where a magnificent, ancient dragon, a known protector of the realm, lies dying, a single, obsidian, cursed arrow embedded in its side, pulsing with the same purple energy that is poisoning the entire valley.
