A group of young women sitting on a bench in a public square, with a large red building in the background. One woman is sitting on the left side of the bench, wearing a beige blazer and black shorts, while the other woman sits on the right side. Both women have fair skin and are smiling at each other. The woman in the foreground has short brown hair and is holding a small black bag. The other woman is wearing a yellow shirt and black pants. There are other people in the square, some sitting and some standing. The square is surrounded by trees and there is a street light illuminating the scene.
