(Underwater Fantasy) A seamless tracking shot follows a mermaid with iridescent scales swimming through a trench in the deep ocean. The trench is lined not with rock, but with the colossal ribcages of long-dead sea gods. Bioluminescent flora grows over the bones, casting a beautiful, ethereal glow on the graveyard of forgotten deities. Awe-inspiring, mythical, deep-sea wonder.
