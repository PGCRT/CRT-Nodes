(Psychological Thriller) A man in an apartment is tormented by the sound of a dripping tap. He finally gets up, walks to the bathroom, and turns the tap off. The dripping sound continues, louder now. He looks up. A single drop of thick, black liquid is forming on the ceiling above him. The camera is a low-angle shot on his face as the drop falls. Slow-burn tension.
