Medium shot of a woman in her early 30s with long, honey-blonde hair in a loose braid, wearing a cream linen dress, standing in a vineyard at twilight—rows of vines stretch into the distance, and a lavender sky casts a gentle glow. Camera slowly dollies in as she kneels beside a vine, retrieving a small, corked vial of dried rose petals—her lips tremble, eyes flickering with memory as she uncorks it. Close-up on her face as she scatters the petals into the breeze, a tear catching the fading light—the vineyard blurs into a dreamy wash of purple and gold, suspending her in a moment of tender release.
