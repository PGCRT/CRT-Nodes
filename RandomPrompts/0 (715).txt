A poised woman with long, wavy auburn hair flowing freely down her back in soft, futuristic waves, wearing a sheer, metallic silver dress with glowing fiber-optic threads that clings to her voluptuous breasts and slender waist, her flawless, tanned skin illuminated by pulsating, neon-blue lighting, standing in a high-tech laboratory with a blurred background of holographic consoles, bubbling vats, and starry windows, her calm brown eyes and subtle smile evoking elegance and intrigue, a delicate cybernetic ring on her finger catching the light, the scene enriched by the faint buzz of machinery, the sharp scent of antiseptic, and the soft hum of quantum processors, creating a photorealistic futuristic portrait that captures her timeless beauty and the cutting-edge, high-energy atmosphere of a sci-fi research facility.
