(Surreal/Comedy) A POV shot from a pigeon, pecking at crumbs in a city square. It looks up and coos. The camera whips around to show another pigeon cooing back. The shot pulls back to reveal they are two giant, building-sized pigeons, having a casual conversation while tiny, terrified humans scurry below them. Deadpan, absurd, shifts in scale.
