Medium shot of a woman in her early 30s with curly auburn hair tucked under a wool beanie, wearing a burgundy parka, standing in a snow-dusted city park at dawn—bare trees cast long shadows, and a soft pink glow bathes the frozen fountain nearby. Camera slowly arcs around her as she kneels beside a stone bench, brushing snow to reveal a carved initials—her breath catches, fingers lingering on the etchings with quiet reverence. Close-up on her face as a tear rolls down her cheek, catching the morning light—the park blurs into a serene wash of white and rose, enveloping her in a moment of tender remembrance.
