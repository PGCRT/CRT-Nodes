(Thriller/Found Footage) A dashcam video from a car driving down a remote forest road at night. The driver swerves to avoid a deer. The car spins out and the camera faces the woods. The headlights flicker. In the brief moments of light, a pale, unnaturally tall figure is seen standing among the trees. In the final flicker, it's standing directly in front of the car, its face pressed against the windshield. High shock value, realistic horror.
