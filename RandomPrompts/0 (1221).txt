A young woman with fair skin and long red hair stands in the middle of a city street, wearing a blue long-sleeved shirt with the word "GUESS" written on it, black pants, and blue flip-flops. She is holding a pink and white plastic bag in one hand and a white water bottle in the other. The background shows a cityscape with tall buildings and parked cars. The woman has a confident and relaxed expression. The image is high quality and has a watermark in the bottom right corner.
