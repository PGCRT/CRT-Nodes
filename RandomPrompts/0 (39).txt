1. Photorealistic image set in Ancient Egyptian era, evoking a mood of divine reverence and quiet intensity. The subject is a priestess with a statuesque and athletic body, golden tanned skin with tribal tattoos, jet black hair in beaded braids, and heavy kohl-rimmed eyes with gilded tears effect. The artistic style is inspired by Baroque oil painting (Caravaggio), with a warm golden hour palette. Shot on ARRI Alexa 65 with a Cooke S4/i 50mm lens, featuring soft blooming highlights and subtle vignetting. Eye-level medium shot, static, framing the priestess kneeling before an altar with burning incense, her expression serene with closed eyes and a faint smile.
