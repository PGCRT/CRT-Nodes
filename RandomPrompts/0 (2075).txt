Photograph of a young woman with long blonde hair, wearing a black coat with a white hood, standing in a narrow street with red chairs and tables. She is holding two pink boxes, one in her left hand and the other in her right hand. The woman has a serious expression and is looking down. In the background, there is a man with a bald head and a red umbrella. The street is cobblestone and there are buildings in the background. The image is high quality and has a watermark in the bottom right corner.
