A radiant woman with long, cascading platinum blonde hair flowing in shimmering, cyberpunk strands past her waist, wearing a sleek, neon-orange bodysuit with glowing circuit patterns that clings to her curvy figure, accentuating her full breasts and toned hips, her smooth, porcelain skin glowing under pulsating, green-hued neon lights, soldering a microchip on a glowing panel | leaping back from a sudden spark in a cluttered cyberworkshop with a blurred background of flickering holographic screens, buzzing drones, and a neon-lit cityscape through a cracked window, her piercing blue eyes focused on her task, a delicate digital implant glinting on her temple, the air thick with the scent of molten metal and ozone, her precise movements exuding expertise, the scene alive with the hum of electronics, the crackle of static, and distant city noise, creating a candid, photorealistic cyberpunk video that captures her technical focus and the vibrant, chaotic atmosphere of a futuristic tech hub at night.
