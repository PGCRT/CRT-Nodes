46. Photorealistic image set in the 1980s Neon Noir, radiating a mood of brooding intensity and urban isolation. The subject is a hacker with a lanky body, pale ivory skin with faint scars, neon blue hair in a faux hawk, and smudged “day after” eyeliner with a sharp jawline. The artistic style is inspired by David Lynch’s surrealism, with a neon palette of pinks and blues. Shot on Arriflex 16SR (16mm) with a wide-angle 18mm lens, featuring light leaks and chromatic aberration. Over-the-shoulder shot, static, showing the hacker typing on a retro computer in a dark room, their expression intense with a furrowed brow.
