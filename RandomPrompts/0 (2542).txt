A woman with long brown hair and a white backpack walking past two large black doors with brass handles. She is wearing a black dress and strappy heels. A man in a black suit is standing to her left, holding a camera. The background shows a stone building with a sign on the door. The woman appears to be in her mid-twenties, with a slender physique and a neutral expression. The lighting is natural and natural, casting shadows on her body.
