(Thriller/Found Footage) A diver's head-mounted camera frantically pans around a murky, sunken shipwreck. The beam of light catches on a treasure chest. | As the diver pries it open, gold coins spill out, but nestled among them is a modern, still-active smartphone, its screen suddenly lighting up with an incoming call from "UNKNOWN". | The diver recoils in shock, and the phone's screen illuminates a monstrous, pale face with huge black eyes right behind him, reflected in the glass. Deep-sea horror, claustrophobic, high shock value.
