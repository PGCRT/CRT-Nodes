A poised woman with long, wavy auburn hair flowing freely down her back in soft, pastoral waves, wearing a sheer, white linen dress with floral embroidery that clings to her voluptuous breasts and slender waist, her flawless, tanned skin illuminated by soft, golden sunlight, tending to a blooming rose garden with delicate pruning shears in a pastoral estate with a blurred background of rolling hills, grazing horses, and a distant manor, her calm brown eyes and subtle smile exuding tranquility, a delicate pearl ring on her finger catching the light, the scene enriched by the sweet scent of roses, the gentle neighing of horses, and the soft rustle of leaves, her nurturing actions exuding care, creating a photorealistic pastoral portrait that captures her timeless beauty and the serene, idyllic atmosphere of a sunlit countryside.
