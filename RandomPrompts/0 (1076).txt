In a high-fantasy setting, a young hedge-witch named Elspeth is gathering herbs in a swamp. She is known for her minor healing poultices. | She finds a rare, pulsating, black lotus and, against her better judgment, decides to use it in a new salve. | A knight with a mortal, cursed wound is brought to her. She applies the black lotus salve, and the wound heals instantly, but the knight's eyes now glow with a malevolent, black energy. She has not healed him; she has traded his life for something much worse.
