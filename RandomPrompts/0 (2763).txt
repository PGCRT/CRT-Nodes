(Historical/Noir) A 1920s silent film starlet practices her exaggerated expressions of fear in a mirror in her dressing room. Her reflection's expression suddenly becomes one of genuine, raw terror. It silently pleads with her, pointing at something over her shoulder, outside the reflection. The starlet, still smiling her fake smile, slowly turns. Classic black-and-white aesthetic, jump scare.
