A slow dolly shot into a beautiful, sunlit greenhouse, where a botanist, Dr. Aris, is cross-pollinating two alien plants. | The resulting hybrid flower blooms instantly, its petals a shimmering, impossible color that seems to shift and change. | She leans in to smell it and is hit with a wave of intense, crippling nostalgia for a home she's never had, on a world she's never seen. The flower's scent is a homesickness bomb for a race that isn't hers.
