A tracking shot follows a woman named Maya, a "beast-tamer" in a fantasy world, as she calmly walks into a cave that is home to a fearsome Manticore. | The Manticore roars, its scorpion tail raised to strike. | Maya ignores the threat, opens a satchel, and pulls out not a weapon, but a large, juicy, perfectly roasted chicken. The Manticore stops roaring and its expression turns from one of ferocity to one of intense, hungry confusion.
