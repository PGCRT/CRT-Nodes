A curvy woman with long, curly raven hair flowing freely down her back in wild, voluminous waves, wearing a sheer, noir-inspired black dress with lace trim that reveals her toned midriff and natural breasts, her smooth, pale skin glowing under dim, smoky streetlights, leaning against a lamppost while lighting a cigarette in a rain-soaked alley with a blurred background of neon signs, wet cobblestones, and shadowy figures, her sultry green eyes glinting with intrigue, a delicate silver locket catching the light, the scene enriched by the patter of rain, the faint scent of tobacco, and the distant wail of a saxophone, her enigmatic pose exuding mystery, creating a photorealistic noir portrait that captures her seductive allure and the moody, atmospheric tension of a gritty urban nightscape.
