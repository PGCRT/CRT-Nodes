Medium shot of a woman in her early 30s with short, copper hair, wearing a loose white blouse, standing barefoot on a moonlit beach—waves lap gently at her feet, and the silver light casts long shadows across the sand. Camera slowly dollies in as she pulls a small seashell from her pocket, her fingers tracing its smooth curves—her face softens, a flicker of hope crossing her eyes. Close-up on her profile as she holds the shell to her ear, a tear catching the moonlight—the ocean blurs into a shimmering veil of silver and blue, isolating her in a moment of quiet serenity.
