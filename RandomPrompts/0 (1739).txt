A slow, creeping dolly shot inside the cramped, dimly lit cockpit of the deep-sea submersible 'The Bathypelagia,' showing Dr. Aris Thorne, a pragmatic biologist in her 40s, her face illuminated by the green glow of sonar screens; the only sounds are the rhythmic ping of the sonar and the gentle hum of the life support as she calmly logs data on abyssal fauna miles below the surface, a look of focused routine on her face. | Suddenly, a piercing klaxon screams through the cockpit and red lights flash, the sonar screen overwhelmed by a mass signature so large it defies classification; the submersible is rocked by a powerful pressure wave, plunging the cockpit into pitch-black darkness as all primary power fails, the silence now deafening and terrifying. | Flickering, battery-powered emergency lights stutter on, casting long, dancing shadows. Aris's panicked breathing is the only sound as she looks to the main viewport, and her blood runs cold. Filling the entire viewport, blotting out the abyss, is the iris of a single, bioluminescent, impossibly ancient eye, its colossal pupil slowly dilating as it observes the tiny metal shell and the terrified woman within.
