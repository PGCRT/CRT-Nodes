The woman on the left is wearing a light blue denim jacket with the letters "L" on it, white pants with red stripes, and red sunglasses. She has long brown hair and is holding a phone in her hand. The man on the right is standing behind a wooden podium, wearing a black t-shirt and glasses. He is also wearing a blue denim jumpsuit and has a serious expression.
