A woman with long brown hair and fair skin stands in the center of a city street, looking over her shoulder with a contemplative expression. She is wearing a black dress with a white blouse underneath, and white boots. The background shows a large metal wall with multiple photographs hanging on it, and a few other people walking by. The scene is bustling with activity, with buildings and a street sign visible in the distance.
