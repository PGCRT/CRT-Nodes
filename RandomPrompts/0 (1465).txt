(Sci-Fi/Dystopia) A drone shot glides over a perfectly manicured, futuristic suburban neighborhood where every house is identical. In one backyard, a woman is tending her garden. The camera zooms in. She looks up, directly at the drone, her pleasant smile never faltering as she slowly and deliberately draws a finger across her throat. The Stepford Wives meets Black Mirror, unsettling, bright pastel colors.
