A poised woman with sleek, shoulder-length auburn hair adorned with a pearl comb, wearing a delicate, cream-colored lace dress with floral embroidery that clings to her slender figure, her flawless, olive skin glowing under soft, gaslit lanterns, arranging a tea tray | gently adjusting a porcelain cup in a cozy Edwardian parlor with a blurred background of velvet armchairs, ticking clocks, and lace curtains, her calm brown eyes focused on her task, a delicate pearl ring catching the light, the air rich with the scent of chamomile and polished wood, her graceful movements exuding refinement, the scene alive with the clink of china, the rustle of fabric, and the distant chime of a grandfather clock, creating a candid, photorealistic Edwardian video that captures her serene elegance and the warm, intimate atmosphere of a refined home at afternoon.
