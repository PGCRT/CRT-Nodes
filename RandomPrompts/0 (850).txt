A woman with long red hair, wearing a black top and a blue and white patterned skirt, standing on a sidewalk in front of a store. She is holding an umbrella over her head and looking at her phone. The store has a large glass window with pink flowers hanging from a metal pole. The woman is wearing green and blue sandals. The image has a soft, dreamy quality with a watermark in the bottom right corner.
