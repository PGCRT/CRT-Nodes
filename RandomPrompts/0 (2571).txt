Medium shot of a woman in her late 20s with auburn hair in a loose braid, wearing a rain-soaked trench coat, standing alone at a foggy train station as a distant horn echoes—neon lights flicker against the wet pavement, casting reflections that ripple beneath her boots | Camera slowly tracks in as she steps forward, lifting an old, weathered photograph from her coat pocket and gazing at it—her expression shifts from composed to quietly aching as the wind picks up, tugging at loose strands of hair | Close-up on her face as a single tear rolls down her freckled cheek—soft backlighting halos her silhouette, and the photo slips from her hand in slow motion, caught in the rising mist and disappearing into the blurred, glowing horizon
