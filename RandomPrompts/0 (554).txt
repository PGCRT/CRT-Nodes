Medium shot of a woman in her early 30s with long, ebony hair flowing freely, wearing a heavy burgundy cloak, standing among the ruins of a snow-dusted cathedral—broken stained-glass windows cast fractured colors across the icy ground. Camera dollies in as she kneels beside a fallen pew, retrieving a small, frost-covered prayer book—her breath clouds in the frigid air, eyes softening with recognition. Close-up on her eyes as she opens the book, a tear shimmering in the reflected colored light—the ruins blur into a serene wash of white and jewel tones, framing her in a moment of sacred stillness.
