(Action/Heist) A split-diopter shot shows a cat burglar in the foreground, delicately disabling a laser grid in a museum, while in the background, a security guard is walking his patrol, unknowingly moments away from discovering her. The tension is created by showing both actions in sharp focus simultaneously. High-stakes suspense, clean cinematography.
