A tense, atmospheric medium shot shows Captain Jax, a hardened space salvager in her 50s, her face lined with the stress of deep space, as she cautiously steps from her airlock into the silent, zero-gravity corridor of the derelict luxury starliner, 'The Seraphim.' The only light is the narrow, powerful beam from her helmet lamp cutting through the darkness, illuminating floating dust motes and frozen champagne glasses. | Her boots magnetize to the floor with a heavy clank. She follows a trail of bizarre, organic-looking scorch marks along the pristine white walls, her pulse rifle held ready. The trail leads her to the ship's opulent ballroom, where the floating, preserved bodies of the crew and passengers are all frozen in poses of ecstatic, silent laughter, their faces contorted in unnatural, joyous terror. | Jax's light beam lands on a single, functioning audio log floating in the center of the room. She activates it with her rifle barrel, and a beautiful, hypnotic, alien melody fills the silence. Her eyes widen in horror as she feels an overwhelming, artificial wave of pure joy wash over her, and she has to fight the sudden, terrifying urge to take off her helmet and join the silent, laughing dance of the dead.
