In a rain-lashed, neon-drenched cyberpunk metropolis, a slow push-in finds "Nyx," a rogue data-auditor in her late 20s, huddled in her cluttered apartment, surrounded by flickering holographic screens. Her face, with its glowing cybernetic eye, is pale and drawn as she sifts through mountains of encrypted corporate data. | With a sudden gasp, she isolates a single, heavily protected data packet. Her cybernetic fingers fly across her console in a blur, bypassing layers of black ice security. The final firewall breaks, revealing not corporate secrets, but a live video feed of a young girl, identical to her own childhood photos, sleeping peacefully in a sterile white room. | The video feed zooms out, revealing the girl is in a high-tech stasis pod labeled "SUBJECT NYX - CLONE SEED 02." A cold, synthesized voice suddenly speaks from Nyx's own speakers: "Primary subject has breached containment. Activating recall protocol." A panel on the back of Nyx's own neck begins to glow red as she realizes she isn't the original, she's the escaped clone.
