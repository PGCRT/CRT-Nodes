(Surreal/Beauty) A woman's eye, macro close-up. A tear forms and falls. As it falls in extreme slow-motion, the camera follows the tear, and we see an entire, detailed snowy landscape with a tiny cabin reflected and contained within the droplet's surface. The tear hits the ground and splashes, the tiny world within shattering. Visually poetic, high-speed photography, melancholic beauty.
