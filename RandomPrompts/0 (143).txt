A young woman with long brown hair and fair skin, wearing a blue jacket and a red scarf, sitting in the foreground with her hands on her chest. She has a serious expression and is looking to the side. Behind her, a man with a beard and a black coat is standing, slightly blurred. The background is a crowded street with other people. The lighting is soft and warm, creating a somber atmosphere. The image is taken from a low angle, looking up at the woman.
