(Sci-Fi/Horror) The POV of a ship's AI during a hull breach. Its vision is corrupted by static and error messages. Through the glitches, it sees the crew being pulled into the vacuum of space. Its final act is to use the ship's last power to play the captain's favorite classical music piece over the comms as its own vision fades to black. Tragic, detached horror, unique perspective.
