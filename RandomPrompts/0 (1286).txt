A slow tracking shot follows a lone woman, a "chrono-geologist," as she walks through a petrified forest where the trees are made of solid, black glass. The sky is a permanent, sickly yellow. | She finds a petrified bird, its wings outstretched in mid-flight. She gently touches it. | The moment she makes contact, a ripple of energy flows from her hand, and the glass bird shatters. From the shards, a ghostly, echo-image of the living bird emerges, chirps once, and flies away. She looks around at the entire forest of glass animals and realizes she has the terrifying power to release every last one of them.
