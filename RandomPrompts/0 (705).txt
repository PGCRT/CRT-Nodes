(Historical/Wonder) In Leonardo da Vinci's workshop, the camera pans across detailed sketches of flying machines. It lands on Leonardo, who is looking intently at a small, intricate metal bird he holds in his palm. | He whispers a word in Italian and releases it. | The mechanical bird comes to life, flits around the room with impossible grace, then flies out the window into the Florentine sky, not as a machine, but as a living, flesh-and-blood swallow. Magical realism, warm, candle-lit atmosphere.
