A woman walking down a narrow street, wearing a white long-sleeved top and high-waisted blue jeans. She is holding two orange plastic bags in her hands. Behind her, a man with a black backpack and a wide-brimmed hat is walking. The street is lined with shops and buildings, and there is a bicycle parked on the right side of the street. The image has a watermark in the bottom right corner.
