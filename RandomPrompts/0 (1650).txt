43. Photorealistic image set in Ancient Egyptian era, evoking a mood of divine reverence and quiet intensity. The subject is a pharaoh with a broad-chested body, golden tanned skin with tribal tattoos, jet black hair in a sculpted avant-garde style, and tribal face paint with a cleft chin. The artistic style is inspired by Baroque oil painting (Caravaggio), with a warm golden hour palette. Shot on ARRI Alexa 65 with a Cooke S4/i 50mm lens, featuring soft blooming highlights and subtle anamorphic lens flares. Eye-level medium shot, static, framing the pharaoh seated on a golden throne, holding a scepter, their expression regal with a stern gaze.
