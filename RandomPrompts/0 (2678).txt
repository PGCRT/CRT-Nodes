(Psychological Thriller) Split-screen. On the left, a woman is painting a beautiful, serene landscape. On the right, a man is trapped in a flooding, concrete room, pounding on the walls. The woman on the left dips her brush in blue paint to add a river to her landscape. As she paints the stroke, the water level on the right side rises violently. She is unknowingly controlling his fate. Intense dramatic irony, minimalist aesthetic.
