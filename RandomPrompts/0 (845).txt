Medium shot of a woman in her late 20s with short, tousled brunette hair, wearing a worn flannel shirt, standing outside a dilapidated riverside shack at twilight—reeds sway in the breeze, and the water reflects the fading orange sky. Camera slowly tracks forward as she pulls a small, weathered journal from her backpack, flipping to a page with a pressed maple leaf—her expression shifts from calm to aching, her fingers trembling as she traces the leaf’s veins. Close-up on her eyes as they well with tears, the river’s glow reflecting in her pupils—the shack and water blur into a warm, golden haze, isolating her in a moment of silent grief.
