Medium shot of a woman in her early 30s with long, chestnut hair in a loose braid, wearing a flowing ivory shawl, standing before a rusted iron gate in an overgrown garden—dawn’s pale light filters through tangled vines, casting intricate shadows. Camera slowly tracks forward as she reaches into her satchel and pulls out a small, worn key, her fingers trembling as she fits it into the lock—her face softens with a flicker of hope. Close-up on her profile as the gate creaks open, sunlight spilling across her features, catching the moisture in her eyes—the garden beyond blurs into a dreamlike haze of green and gold, framing her in quiet anticipation.
