(Musical/Horror) A smoky, 1930s speakeasy. A beautiful singer in a velvet dress croons a hauntingly beautiful, slow jazz melody. The camera is a slow, intimate pan across the entranced audience. As her voice hits a high, ethereal note, the audience members don't applaud; they begin to silently and gracefully crumble into fine grey dust, their clothes falling empty onto the chairs. Elegant, chilling horror.
