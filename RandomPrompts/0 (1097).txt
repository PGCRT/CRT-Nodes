Medium shot of Elara skillfully navigating a chaotic tavern, effortlessly carrying three heavy steins of ale. A drunken patron stumbles and knocks a tray of goblets from her hands. | In a flash of innate grace, she executes a perfect, fluid spin, catching all three goblets before they hit the floorâ€”a move of impossible aristocratic refinement that silences the entire tavern. | A grim-faced knight in the corner, wearing the King's royal sigil, slowly stands up, his eyes locked on her, a look of utter disbelief on his face. Elara sees the sigil on his armor, and her face pales as she realizes her life in hiding is over.
