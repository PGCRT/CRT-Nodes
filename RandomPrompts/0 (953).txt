In a grimy, forgotten speakeasy, a blues singer named Hattie, her voice raw and full of sorrow, sings on a small stage. The room is almost empty. | A sharply dressed man who seems out of place offers to make her famous, handing her a silver fountain pen and a contract. | She takes the pen to sign, but the ink is not black; it's a shimmering, blood-red. She realizes he is not a record producer, but something much, much older, and she slowly pushes the contract back across the table.
