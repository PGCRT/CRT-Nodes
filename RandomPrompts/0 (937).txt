(Sci-Fi) An explorer on a jungle planet pushes aside a giant leaf, revealing a clearing. In the center, a colossal, biological 'computer' hums with lifeâ€”its 'wires' are thick, pulsing vines, and its 'monitors' are massive, pollen-dusted flowers that display shifting fractal patterns. A handheld, shaky-cam shot conveys the explorer's utter astonishment. Avatar-style bioluminescent flora, high detail, sense of discovery.
