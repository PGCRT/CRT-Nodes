A young woman with curly blonde hair sitting on a wooden bench in a park. She is wearing a black leather jacket, a black turtleneck, and black pants. She has a serious expression and is holding a coffee cup in her right hand. A small black dog is sitting next to her. The background is blurred, but it appears to be an outdoor setting with other people sitting and walking. The image is high quality and has a watermark in the bottom right corner.
