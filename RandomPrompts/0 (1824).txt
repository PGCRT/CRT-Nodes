Medium shot of a woman in her late 20s with sun-bleached blonde hair tied in a loose ponytail, wearing a faded navy peacoat, standing alone on a weathered wooden pier at dusk—waves lap gently beneath, and a distant lighthouse pulses faintly through the fog. Camera slowly tracks in as she pulls a crumpled letter from her pocket, her fingers tracing the ink-smudged words—her expression shifts from stoic to fragile, the sea breeze tugging at her scarf. Close-up on her face as a tear catches the fading sunlight, her eyes reflecting the horizon’s amber glow—the letter trembles in her hand, and the background blurs into a soft wash of gray and gold, isolating her in a fleeting moment of quiet sorrow.
