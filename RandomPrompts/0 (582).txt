46. Photorealistic image set in the Italian Renaissance, evoking a mood of artistic passion and quiet longing. The subject is a sculptor with a compact and muscular body, tanned golden skin with calloused hands, chestnut brown hair in a messy bun, and no makeup with a sharp jawline. The artistic style is inspired by Caravaggioâ€™s Baroque oil painting, with a high-contrast chiaroscuro palette. Shot on ARRI Alexa 65 with a Cooke S4/i 50mm lens, featuring soft blooming highlights and subtle anamorphic lens flares. Eye-level medium shot, static, framing the sculptor chiseling a marble statue, their expression intense with furrowed brows.
