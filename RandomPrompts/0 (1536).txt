Medium shot of Elara kneeling inside a hand-drawn chalk circle, the attic room lit only by dozens of flickering candles, her young face a mask of intense concentration as she chants in a low voice from a massive, iron-bound grimoire. | The flames of the candles all bend inward and turn a cold, ghostly blue; a whisper echoes through the room, answering her call, and a triumphant, relieved smile flashes across her face as she thinks she has succeeded. | Her smile vanishes, replaced by sheer terror, as the whispering voice deepens into a cold, ancient, and mocking laugh that does not belong to her grandmother; the shadows in the room coalesce into a tall, smiling figure that is not human, and the chalk circle begins to smoke and sizzle.
