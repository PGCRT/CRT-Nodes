Two women walking down a cobblestone street, both wearing face masks. The woman on the left has blonde hair and is wearing a dark blue dress with a high collar and short sleeves. She is wearing sunglasses and carrying a black handbag. The other woman, with long brown hair and a black shirt and blue jeans, is also wearing a face mask. The background shows a grand building with tall columns and a red car parked on the side. The image is framed with a black border.
