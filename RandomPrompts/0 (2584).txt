(Horror) A group of friends are telling ghost stories around a campfire. One person is telling a story about a man with a hook for a hand. The camera is a slow, 360-degree orbital pan around the fire, focusing on each listener's scared face. As the camera completes its circle and returns to the storyteller, he has finished his story, and is now revealed to have a rusty, bloody hook for a hand. Classic horror trope with a shocking reveal.
