A slow, tense tracking shot follows Anya, an undercover agent disguised as a journalist, as she walks through the opulent, crowded ballroom of a rogue nation's dictator. Her senses are on high alert, her smile a perfect, deceptive mask. | She secures a brief, private audience with the dictator under the pretense of an interview. As he boasts, she uses a micro-scanner in her ring to surreptitiously copy the data from his personal datapad sitting on the table. | The scan completes, but instead of military secrets, the data transfer reveals a live bio-metric feed showing that the dictator's heart is a ticking time bomb, set to detonate in less than five minutes, turning her simple espionage mission into a desperate race to escape a human bomb in the middle of a packed room.
