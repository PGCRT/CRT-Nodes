Medium shot of a woman in her late 20s with wavy, dark brown hair, wearing a heavy gray sweater, standing outside a cliffside lighthouse at dusk—waves crash below, and a stormy sky churns above. Camera slowly pushes in as she opens a small, brass compass, its needle spinning wildly—her lips tremble, eyes softening with a pang of memory. Close-up on her profile as a tear rolls down her cheek, catching the lighthouse’s fleeting beam—the sea blurs into a turbulent wash of gray and blue, isolating her in a moment of quiet resolve.
