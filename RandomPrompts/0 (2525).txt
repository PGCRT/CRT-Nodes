23. Cinematic image set in the World War II era, conveying a mood of quiet courage and grim resolve. The subject is a nurse with a petite and slender body, pale ivory skin with freckles, auburn hair in a Gibson tuck, and natural makeup with a single tear. The artistic style is inspired by Italian Neorealism, with a sepia-toned palette. Shot on Arriflex 435 (35mm) with a spherical 50mm lens, featuring visible dust and scratches and heavy vignetting. High-angle close-up, static, framing the nurse bandaging a soldierâ€™s wound in a field hospital, her expression compassionate with pursed lips.
