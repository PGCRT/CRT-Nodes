(Fantasy/Horror) A knight in shining armor cautiously enters a grand, gothic cathedral. The camera follows him from behind. Sunlight streams through stained-glass windows. He approaches the altar. | The camera slowly pans up from his boots to his helmet, but when it reaches the helmet, it keeps panning up, revealing the 'knight' is just an empty suit of armor, standing impossibly on its own. | The stained-glass windows behind the armor suddenly shatter inwards, as if from a silent scream. Dark Souls aesthetic, oppressive atmosphere, jump scare.
