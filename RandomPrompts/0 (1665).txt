An extreme wide shot of a desolate, frozen tundra. A lone researcher, Dr. Anya Sharma, in a thick parka, follows a strange energy signal on her handheld device. | The signal leads her to a fissure in the ice. Peering down, she sees not rock, but the smooth, metallic hull of a massive, buried structure. | She rappels down and finds a huge, alien door covered in symbols. She touches one, and the door itself dematerializes, revealing a perfectly preserved, lush, tropical jungle thriving in a cavern deep beneath the ice.
