A photograph of a woman with a slender physique and fair skin, wearing a black hooded jacket, standing in a city street at night. She is holding a can of coffee in her right hand and a piece of paper in her left hand. She has long black hair and is carrying a large, beige handbag on her left shoulder. The background is blurred, but it appears to be a cityscape with tall buildings and a soft, warm light. The image has a watermark in the bottom right corner.
