(Sci-Fi/Body Horror) A scientist in a pristine lab injects herself with a glowing green serum. The camera is a tight close-up on her arm. Her skin doesn't bleed; instead, it becomes translucent, revealing her veins are turning into tiny, crystalline branches, and her bones are slowly morphing into a polished, wood-like substance. Not grotesque, but a beautiful, terrifying, and silent transformation. Cronenberg-style, clinical aesthetic.
