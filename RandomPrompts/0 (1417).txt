(Surreal) A seamlessly looping video (GIF-style). A person is walking up a spiral staircase. When they reach the top, they walk through a door that leads them to the bottom of the same staircase, to continue their endless ascent. The lighting subtly changes with each loop, shifting from day to night, summer to winter, showing the passage of a lifetime in a few seconds. Hypnotic, melancholic, Escher-inspired.
