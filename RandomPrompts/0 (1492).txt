(Surreal/Noir) A detective is investigating a crime scene where the victim was erased from existence. There's no body, just a person-shaped void in the fabric of reality in the middle of the room. The detective cautiously sticks his hand into the void, and it vanishes. He pulls back a stump, but feels no pain. High-concept, existential dread.
