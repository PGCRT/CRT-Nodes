(Fantasy/Noir) A goblin detective in a smoke-filled 1940s office examines a clue on his desk: a single, perfectly preserved fairy wing under a magnifying glass. A dramatic rack focus shifts from the intricate wing to the reflection in the glass, showing a towering, shadowy figure with antlers standing in the doorway behind him. High contrast, chiaroscuro lighting, classic noir suspense.
