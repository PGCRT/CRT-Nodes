A group of people standing around a stone statue in a square, with a woman sitting on the right side of the image. She has long brown hair and is wearing a black t-shirt and ripped jeans. A man with a muscular build and a white shirt and red pants is crouched on the ground, taking a photo of the woman. He is holding a camera in his hands and appears to be taking a picture. In the background, there are several other people, including a boy with a backpack and a girl with a camera, all of them looking at the statue. The scene is brightly lit with natural light.
