11. Cinematic image set in the Bronze Age Minoan era, conveying a mood of ritualistic devotion and ancient mystery. The subject is a priest with a stocky body, tanned golden skin with body paint, jet black hair in a sculpted avant-garde style, and tribal face paint with a cleft chin. The artistic style is inspired by Symbolism (Klimt), with a warm metallic palette of golds and bronzes. Shot on Panavision Panaflex System 65 (65mm) with a Cooke S4/i 50mm lens, featuring soft blooming highlights and fine film grain. Low-angle wide shot, static, showing the priest raising a ceremonial dagger in a frescoed temple, his expression intense with narrowed eyes.
