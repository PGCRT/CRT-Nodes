(Sci-Fi/Awe) A lone janitor pushes a floor buffer down the long, curved tunnel of a decommissioned particle accelerator. The camera is a low, steady tracking shot. As the buffer passes, it doesn't polish the concrete but wipes away the grime to reveal the floor is a perfect window into deep space, showing swirling nebulae and distant galaxies beneath his feet. Quiet, cosmic awe, stark industrial setting.
