(Fantasy) A young faun with small horns and goat-like legs plays a wooden flute in a sun-dappled ancient forest. As he plays, the trees themselves slowly begin to waltz, their branches intertwining and their roots lifting from the ground to dance in a slow, graceful rhythm. The camera gently sways and orbits, as if dancing with them. Pan's Labyrinth aesthetic, magical and whimsical.
