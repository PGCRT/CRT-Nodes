realtime motion, dynamic movements  A high-resolution photograph: medium shot of a young woman with fair skin, dark brown hair in a messy bun, seated on a tiled floor. She wears a loose, light blue robe partially unbuttoned to reveal cleavage; mild surprise/discomfort registers on her face as she holds a small tattoo on her left leg with her right hand. Soft, warm light filters through a large window with a silver handle, illuminating the plain textured wall background. | Close-up: A gentle rack focus emphasizes her hand and the subtle details of the tattoo as she shifts slightly, revealing more of the robeâ€™s texture. The soft backlighting creates elongated shadows across the tiled floor. | Medium shot: Her expression softens to contemplative curiosity. She slowly straightens up, lifting her gaze towards the window, a hint of vulnerability in her half-closed eyes and the way she holds herself now.|
