A beautiful shot of a woman named Elara, a celestial artist, on a moon base. She is using a special tool to paint with captured starlight on a black canvas. | She paints a perfect rendition of Earth as seen from the moon. | As she adds the final swirl of clouds, the painting begins to gently rotate and glow, a perfect, living, miniature replica of the planet hanging in her studio.
