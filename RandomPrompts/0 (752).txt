A young woman with fair skin and blonde hair, kneeling on the ground in a grassy area, drawing with chalk on a concrete surface. She is wearing a sleeveless grey top and denim shorts, and is holding a yellow ball in her right hand. The background is a concrete wall, and the lighting is bright and natural. The image is high quality and has a watermark in the bottom right corner.
