(Awe/Finale) An astronaut on the moon plants a flag. As she does, she accidentally disturbs a patch of lunar soil. The soil begins to glow. The glow spreads like a wave across the entire surface of the moon, revealing ancient, intricate patterns and circuits beneath the grey dust. The moon is not a rock; it is a dormant, planet-sized machine, and she has just switched it on. Mind-bending scale, ultimate sense of discovery.
