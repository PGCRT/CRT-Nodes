(Historical/Fantasy) Joan of Arc stands bound to a stake, flames beginning to lick at her feet. The camera is a tight close-up on her face, serene and looking to the heavens. | As the fire intensifies, her eyes begin to glow with brilliant, white-hot light. The ropes burn away, but she doesn't move. | A massive pair of fiery, angelic wings erupt from her back, incinerating her captors and turning the night into day. Awe-inspiring, revisionist history, epic visual effects.
