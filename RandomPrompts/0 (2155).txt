Wide shot of Lyra, a lone, serene blue-skinned alien, standing in the center of a massive, intimidating circular chamber, facing a council of stern-faced human generals in military attire. | She closes her large, dark eyes, and a shimmering, holographic sphere of light emanates from her, projecting beautiful and heartbreaking scenes of her peaceful civilization's history, their art, their families, their hopes. | The projection fades, and Lyra opens her eyes, which are now filled with tears. She stands vulnerable and silent before the council, her people's entire fate resting on whether her emotional plea has broken through their hostility.
