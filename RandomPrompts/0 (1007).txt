She is armed with a sharpened rebar staff. | A horde of savage, book-burning raiders attacks the library doors. | She stands before them alone and begins to recite the opening lines of an epic poem. Her voice, full of power and passion, is so captivating that the lead raider hesitates, his weapon lowering an inch as he becomes enthralled by the story.
