In a gritty, cyberpunk city, a "chrome-ripper" named Sasha works in a back-alley clinic, removing cybernetic implants from those who can't pay their debts. It's a brutal, grim job. | A client comes in with a top-of-the-line optic implant. As Sasha begins the removal procedure, the implant projects a live feed directly into her own visionâ€”a feed of the client's terrified, crying daughter being held hostage by the corporation that owns the debt. | Sasha stops the procedure, her hand trembling. She looks from the terrified man in her chair to the cold, cruel tools of her trade. She powers down her tools, looks the man in the eye, and says, "Change of plans. We're going to get your daughter back."
