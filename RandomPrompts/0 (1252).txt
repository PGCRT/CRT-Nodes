In a grimy auto shop, a young woman named Ria is building a custom hot rod. Her hands are stained with grease, but her work is meticulous. | She installs the engineâ€”a strange, pulsating, bio-mechanical hybrid she salvaged from a crashed UFO. | She turns the key. The engine doesn't roar; it lets out a low, guttural, and distinctly biological purr, and the headlights blink open like a predator's eyes.
