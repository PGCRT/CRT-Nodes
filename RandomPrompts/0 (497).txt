(Sci-Fi/Comedy) An alien tourist, looking like a classic "grey," stands confused in the middle of Times Square. A dramatic, heroic 360-degree orbital shot captures the chaos and light around him. He pulls out a guidebook, which is just a single, smooth rock. He shrugs, puts the rock to his head, then confidently tries to pay for a hotdog with a handful of lint. Fish-out-of-water comedy, visual overload.
