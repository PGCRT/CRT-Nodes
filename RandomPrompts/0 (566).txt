(Prehistoric Fantasy) A low-angle shot in a dark cave, lit by a single flickering torch. A Neanderthal shaman paints the wall with a paste made from glowing mushrooms. The camera follows his hand as he completes the figure of a bison. The moment the line is complete, the entire painting animates, detaching from the rock as a life-sized creature of pure, shimmering light that gallops around the awe-struck shaman. Primal, magical, high-contrast lighting.
