(Surreal) A man sits on a psychiatrist's couch, explaining his dream. As he talks, the couch, the room, and the psychiatrist begin to slowly melt like wax, dripping onto the floor in colorful puddles, until the man is left sitting alone in a vast, empty, white void, still talking. Abstract, visual metaphor, psychologically jarring.
