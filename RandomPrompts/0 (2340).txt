A young woman with fair skin and brown hair, sitting on a concrete wall in an alleyway. She is wearing a white tank top and pink patterned shorts, with white sandals on her feet. She has a black belt around her waist and is holding a can of soda in her right hand. The background features graffiti-covered walls and a brown paper bag on the left side. The lighting is bright and natural, casting shadows on her body. The image is high quality and has a watermark in the bottom right corner.
