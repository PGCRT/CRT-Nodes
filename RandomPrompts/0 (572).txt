A wide shot of a desolate, wind-swept salt flat. A lone woman, a nomad named Kira, is leading a massive, furry, six-legged beast of burden. | The beast suddenly stops, lets out a low, mournful groan, and refuses to move. Kira tries to coax it, then notices the ground beneath its feet is vibrating rhythmically. | She presses her ear to the salty ground and hears a deep, mechanical, grinding sound from far below. The camera pulls back to reveal the entire salt flat is just the thin crust on top of a single, impossibly large, ancient piece of machinery that is slowly beginning to wake up.
