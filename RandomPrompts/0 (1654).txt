42. Hyperrealistic image set in a Lost World (Dinosaurs), evoking a mood of primal fear and awe. The subject is an explorer with a broad-shouldered and powerful body, tanned golden skin spattered with mud, chestnut brown hair in a messy bun, and no makeup with a cleft chin. The artistic style is inspired by fantasy art (Frazetta), with a warm metallic palette of golds and bronzes. Shot on RED Komodo with a macro 100mm lens, featuring fine film grain and shallow depth of field. Low-angle wide shot, static, capturing the explorer facing a towering dinosaur in a jungle, their expression a mix of terror and fascination with wide eyes.
