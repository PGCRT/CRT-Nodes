A lone woman, Elara, is the keeper of a griffin aerie high in the mountains. She has a deep, maternal bond with the beasts. | A poacher's arrow strikes the wing of the lead griffin. | Elara's gentle expression turns to one of cold fury. She lets out a piercing whistle, and a dozen other griffins launch into the air, following her as she rappels down the cliff face to hunt the hunters.
