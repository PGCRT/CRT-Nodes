In the image, a woman with long dark hair is lying on her stomach on a wet beach. She is wearing a shimmering, beaded top that catches the light from the setting sun. The sky behind her has hues of orange and pink, indicating that it is either sunrise or sunset. The ocean in the background is calm with gentle waves lapping at the shore. There are no other people visible in the frame, giving the scene a serene and solitary atmosphere.
