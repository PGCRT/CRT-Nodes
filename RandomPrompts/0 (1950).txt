(Psychological Thriller) A woman is in a therapy session. Her therapist asks her to close her eyes and describe her "happy place." She describes a beautiful, sunny beach. The camera, however, stays on her face, and reflected in her closed eyelids, we see a terrifying, dark, monstrous figure approaching. The horror is only visible to the audience. Intense dramatic irony.
