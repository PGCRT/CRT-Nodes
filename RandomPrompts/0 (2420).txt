(Surreal/Melancholy) An old man sits on a park bench, releasing a single soap bubble from a wand. The camera follows the bubble as it floats away. Inside the shimmering, transparent sphere, a perfect, miniature memory of the man's wedding day plays out in silent, joyful motion. The bubble pops, and the memory vanishes. The old man smiles sadly and blows another. Heartbreaking, soft focus, dreamlike.
