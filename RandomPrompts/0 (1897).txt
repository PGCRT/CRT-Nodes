A radiant woman with long, cascading silver hair flowing in shimmering, steampunk coils past her waist, wearing a form-fitting leather corset dress with brass cogs that clings to her curvy figure, accentuating her full breasts and toned hips, her smooth, porcelain skin glowing under warm, gaslit lanterns, adjusting a whirring mechanical arm | ducking under a burst of steam in a bustling airship workshop with a blurred background of copper pipes, spinning propellers, and smoky skies, her piercing blue eyes focused on her task, a delicate cog-shaped pendant glinting on her chest, the air thick with the scent of oil and steam, her nimble movements exuding ingenuity, the scene alive with the clank of gears, the hiss of steam, and distant airship horns, creating a candid, photorealistic steampunk video that captures her inventive focus and the vibrant, mechanical atmosphere of a retro-futuristic hangar at dusk.
