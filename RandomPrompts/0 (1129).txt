A poised woman with long, straight raven hair cascading in a glossy sheet, wearing a delicate, cream-colored kimono with crane embroidery that accentuates her slender figure, her flawless, porcelain skin glowing under soft, paper lantern light, arranging a bonsai tree | gently trimming a branch in a tranquil tea house with a blurred background of tatami mats, sliding shoji screens, and a misty garden, her calm brown eyes focused on her craft, a delicate jade ring catching the light, the air rich with the scent of green tea and cedar, her graceful movements exuding serenity, the scene alive with the clink of porcelain, the rustle of leaves, and the distant trickle of a fountain, creating a candid, photorealistic Japanese traditional video that captures her refined elegance and the serene, meditative atmosphere of a tea ceremony at dawn.
