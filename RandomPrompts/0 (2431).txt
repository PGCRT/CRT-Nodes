Medium shot of a woman in her early 30s with cropped copper hair, wearing a black velvet blazer, standing on the stage of an abandoned theater—faded red curtains hang tattered, and a single spotlight casts a pool of light around her. Camera slowly tracks in as she kneels to pick up a crumpled playbill from the dusty floor, her fingers brushing over a handwritten note on the back—her expression shifts from curious to haunted. Close-up on her eyes as they glisten with tears, the spotlight haloing her face—the theater fades into a warm blur of crimson and gold, isolating her in a moment of quiet revelation.
