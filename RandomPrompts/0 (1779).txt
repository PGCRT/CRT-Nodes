Medium shot of Chloe, a struggling artist, slumped in her cluttered studio, staring at a blank canvas with a look of utter creative despair. She finds an old, ornate paintbrush with strange carvings on the handle at the bottom of a junk box. | In a fit of inspiration, she dips the strange brush in black paint and begins to paint a dark, abstract forest; the paint flows from the brush with unnatural ease, creating shapes she didn't intend. | She steps back to look at her work and drops the brush in horror; the painted trees on the canvas are now subtly swaying, and a pair of glowing red eyes have opened within the painted shadows, staring directly out at her.
