In a vast, empty desert, a woman named Kira finds a single, ornate, free-standing door. There are no walls, just a door and its frame. | She hesitates, then opens the door. | The view through the open doorway is not of the desert behind it, but of a bustling, vibrant, and completely alien city under a green sky. She can feel the wind and smell the strange food from the other side.
