A woman with long black hair, wearing a white tank top and light blue ripped jeans, standing in front of a store with a "Sale" sign on the glass. She is holding a small black and white handbag and looking at the camera with a confident expression. The store has a modern, minimalist design with a concrete facade and large windows. The lighting is bright and natural, casting shadows on the ground. The image is high quality and has a watermark in the bottom left corner.
