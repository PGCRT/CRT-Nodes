Two women sitting on a motor scooter at an outdoor market. One woman is wearing a yellow cardigan and a blue skirt, while the other is wearing black pants and a black top. Both women have long hair and are wearing sunglasses. The woman on the left is holding the steering wheel and appears to be looking down at her phone. The background shows other people, a bicycle, and a stall with various items. The image is slightly blurred, with a watermark in the bottom right corner.
