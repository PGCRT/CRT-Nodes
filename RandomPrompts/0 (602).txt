A woman standing in front of a building with a sign that says "ACY's" on the left side. She is wearing a white crop top and light blue jeans, with a black crossbody bag slung over her shoulder. She has long brown hair and is looking to the side with a neutral expression. The woman is holding a cup of coffee in her hand. The building behind her has large glass windows and ornate details. The lighting is soft and natural, casting gentle shadows. The image is high quality and has a watermark in the bottom left corner.
