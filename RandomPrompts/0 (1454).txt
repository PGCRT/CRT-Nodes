A young woman with fair skin and long brown hair, wearing a bright orange t-shirt and blue jeans, standing in a parking lot. She is holding a pair of scissors in her right hand and a piece of paper in her left hand. In the background, there is a large building with a red canopy and a sign that says "RESBURGER". The sky is blue with some clouds. The woman is looking down at the paper with a smile on her face.
