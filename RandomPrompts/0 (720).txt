(Thriller) Close-up on a childâ€™s drawing of a happy family outside a house. The camera pulls back to reveal the drawing is taped to the inside of a locked closet door. We hear muffled screaming from the other side. | A small, shadowy hand reaches into the frame and draws a tall, dark, smiling figure behind the family in the drawing using a black crayon. | The screaming on the other side of the door abruptly stops. Low-key lighting, intense psychological dread, minimalism.
