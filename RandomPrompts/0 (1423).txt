Two Japanese women walking down a city street, both wearing casual clothing. The woman on the left is wearing a beige cardigan over a white shirt and black and white polka-dot pants, while the woman in the middle has dark hair and a black fur coat. Both women are holding white bags in their hands. The street is lined with shops and buildings, and there are people walking in the background. The lighting is bright and natural, casting shadows on the ground. The women have a smile on their faces.
