Medium shot of a woman in her early 30s with cropped, silver hair, wearing a black turtleneck, standing in a cavernous factory loft at dawn—sunlight streams through broken windows, illuminating floating dust motes. Camera slowly tracks in as she approaches a dusty easel, lifting a cloth to reveal an unfinished painting—her posture stiffens, eyes narrowing with recognition. Close-up on her face as she traces the brushstrokes, a tear shimmering in the soft light—the loft fades into a hazy blend of gray and gold, framing her in a moment of quiet fascination.
