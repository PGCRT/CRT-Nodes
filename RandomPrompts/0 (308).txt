(Historical/Steampunk) A frantic, dynamic shot inside a Victorian-era submarine, all brass pipes and hissing steam. It's being attacked by a giant squid. The crew scrambles. The captain, instead of firing a torpedo, pulls a massive lever that activates a series of colossal gramophone horns on the hull, blasting a deafening operatic high note that shatters the squid's eyes. Jules Verne-inspired, chaotic action.
