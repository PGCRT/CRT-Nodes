A medium shot of a young, idealistic "word-warden," Elara, tasked with guarding a library of cursed books. She is polishing the magical chains that bind a particularly dangerous-looking tome. | A senior warden tells her the book is cursed to drive any reader to madness by showing them the "ultimate truth." | That night, unable to resist the temptation, she picks the magical lock and opens the book. It is filled with nothing but completely blank pages. The ultimate, maddening truth is that there is no ultimate truth. She begins to laugh, a sound that starts as a chuckle and slowly escalates into unhinged, hysterical despair.
