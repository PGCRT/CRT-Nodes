(Historical/Sci-Fi) A 1950s suburban family gathers around a new television set. The father turns it on. Instead of a fuzzy black-and-white broadcast, the screen shows a crystal-clear, 8K color image of a futuristic, alien city under a purple sky. The family stares, mesmerized and terrified, at the impossible signal. Twilight Zone-esque, period detail meets high-concept sci-fi.
