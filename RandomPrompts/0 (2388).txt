A young woman with long, curly brown hair and glasses, wearing a white long-sleeved shirt, raising her right arm in the air with her mouth open. She is standing in front of a crowd of people, with a blurred cityscape in the background. A man with a bald head and glasses is standing to her right, looking up at her. The lighting is soft and natural, casting gentle shadows. The woman has a peaceful expression on her face.
