(Fantasy/Legal Drama) A majestic courtroom made of living wood and marble. A human lawyer in a sharp suit stands before a judge's bench carved from the trunk of a colossal, ancient Ent. The lawyer presents evidence: a shimmering, holographic memory projection showing the defendant, a tiny, winged pixie, siphoning laughter from children, which manifests as golden light. High fantasy meets A Few Good Men, grand and whimsical.
