A cinematic shot of a young woman named Kai, a "mech-gladiator," standing in the pits of a massive arena. She is patching the battered armor of her giant, outdated robot. | Her opponent for the championship is a state-of-the-art, military-grade mech piloted by a sneering champion. Kai's chances are zero. | As she climbs into the cockpit, she finds a small, hidden switch her grandfather, the mech's original pilot, installed. She flips it. The mech's eyes glow red, and a forgotten, brutally efficient combat AI from a long-lost war boots up, overriding the manual controls. Her outdated mech now moves with a terrifying, lethal grace.
