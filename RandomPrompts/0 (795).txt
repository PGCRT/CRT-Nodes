(Surreal/Noir) A detective in a trench coat stands on a city street at night, but the rain is falling upwards, sizzling back into the dark clouds. Neon signs bleed their colors into the rising puddles on the ceiling of the sky. The camera does a slow, disorienting barrel roll to show him lighting a cigarette, the smoke also falling upwards. High-contrast, surreal noir, deeply atmospheric and confusing.
