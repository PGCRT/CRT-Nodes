Medium shot of a woman in her early 30s with curly, silver hair, wearing a navy wool coat, standing in the yard of an old factory at dusk—rusted machinery looms, and faint light spills from a cracked window. Camera slowly dollies in as she pulls a small, tarnished key from her pocket, her fingers brushing over its worn surface—her brow furrows, eyes shimmering with recognition. Close-up on her face as a tear catches the fading light, reflecting the factory’s silhouette—the yard blurs into a hazy mix of amber and gray, suspending her in a moment of quiet discovery.
