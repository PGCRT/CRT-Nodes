A gritty shot of a woman named Brenna, a bare-knuckle fighter in an underground fight club, her face bruised but her eyes full of fire. She is facing an opponent twice her size. | The bell rings, and she dodges the larger fighter's clumsy haymaker, responding with a series of precise, lightning-fast strikes to his pressure points. | The giant fighter doesn't just fall; he freezes, his eyes glazing over. She didn't just hit him; her strange chi-strikes have temporarily disconnected his consciousness from his body, leaving him a motionless statue as she calmly walks away.
