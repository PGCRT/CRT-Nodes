A young woman with a slender build and fair skin stands on a city street at night, looking over her shoulder with a contemplative expression. She has long brown hair tied in a ponytail and is wearing a tight, off-the-shoulder, beige dress with a frilled skirt. She is wearing red high heels and has a small black handbag on her shoulder. The background is blurred, but it appears to be an outdoor market with people and vehicles. The lighting is soft and warm, creating a serene atmosphere.
