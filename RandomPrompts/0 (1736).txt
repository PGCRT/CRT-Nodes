A young woman with fair skin and brown hair wearing a long, maroon, hooded coat with a white face mask, standing on a cobblestone street in a city. She is looking to the side with a serious expression. In the background, two other women, one wearing a gray jacket and blue jeans, and the other wearing a white headscarf, are walking along the street. The street is empty, with no cars or people in sight. The sky is overcast and the ground is covered in snow. The image is taken from a low angle, looking up at the woman in the foreground.
