50. Cinematic image set in the 1970s Disco Era, conveying a mood of vibrant energy and fleeting joy. The subject is a singer with a slim-thick body, dewy luminous skin with glitter, honey blonde hair in a voluminous 70s blowout, and bold colorful eyeshadow with glossy lips. The artistic style is inspired by Pop Art (Warhol), with a neon palette of pinks and purples. Shot on Panavision Panaflex GII (35mm) with a Panavision C-Series Anamorphic 50mm lens, featuring anamorphic lens flares and dreamy bokeh. Eye-level medium shot, static, capturing the singer performing on a glowing stage, their expression ecstatic with a wide smile.
