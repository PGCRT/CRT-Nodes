A photograph of two young women sitting on a sidewalk in front of a store. The woman on the left has long brown hair and is wearing a dark blue cardigan and white shorts. She is sitting on the ground with her legs spread apart, looking at the other woman with a smile. The other woman, with long blonde hair and a green sweater, is sitting next to her. Both women have fair skin and are wearing black sneakers. The background shows a store with large windows and a poster on the sidewalk. The lighting is bright and natural, casting shadows on their bodies.
