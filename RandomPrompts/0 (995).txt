(Thriller) A lone librarian is shelving books in a vast, silent, labyrinthine library at night. He places a book back on a shelf. The shelf immediately slides back, revealing that the entire library is a complex, shifting mechanical puzzle. He turns to see the path he came from is now a solid wall of books. He is trapped. Claustrophobic, Escher-esque, intellectual dread.
