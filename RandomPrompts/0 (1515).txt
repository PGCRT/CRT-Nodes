Medium shot of a woman in her early 30s with short, silver hair, wearing a black velvet blazer, standing on the balcony of an old theater—faded velvet seats stretch below, and a single spotlight casts a soft glow. Camera slowly tracks in as she pulls a crumpled playbill from her bag, her fingers brushing over a handwritten note—her expression shifts from curious to haunted. Close-up on her eyes as they glisten with tears, the spotlight haloing her face—the theater fades into a warm blur of crimson and gold, framing her in a moment of quiet revelation.
