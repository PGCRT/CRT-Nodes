(Fantasy/Nature) A time-lapse sequence of a forest floor. An acorn falls. The camera pushes in as it sprouts. Instead of a sapling, a tiny, perfect, intricate city of green, living wood grows from the ground, with miniature bridges, towers, and pathways forming from the roots and leaves, all in a matter of seconds. Enchanting, high-detail, magical ecology.
