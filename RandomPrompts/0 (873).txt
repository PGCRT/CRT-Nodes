The image captures a woman crouching on the grass, her body turned towards the camera. She is dressed in a white blouse with a high neckline and short sleeves, paired with brown boots that contrast against the greenery around her. A white headscarf, adorned with small white dots, hangs down from her forehead. The background is a lush tapestry of trees and bushes, their leaves a vibrant mix of greens. To the right of the woman's feet rests a woven basket, its contents hidden from view. Her gaze is steady, as if she has just finished an activity or perhaps paused to look at something off-camera.
