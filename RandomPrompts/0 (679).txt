A woman with long brown hair and a tattoo standing in front of a French restaurant. She is wearing a red t-shirt and a black skirt, and is facing away from the viewer. The restaurant has a large red awning with the word "Bienvenue" written on it. There are several people sitting at tables outside the restaurant, some sitting on chairs and others standing. The atmosphere is casual and relaxed.
