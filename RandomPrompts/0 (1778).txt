36. Hyperrealistic image set in a High Middle Ages cathedral, evoking a mood of solemn devotion and quiet awe. The subject is a pilgrim with a soft and rounded body, pale ivory skin with rosacea, ash blonde hair in a Dutch braid crown, and no makeup with laugh lines. The artistic style is inspired by Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, with a warm golden hour palette. Shot on ARRI Alexa LF with a Cooke S4/i 85mm lens, featuring soft blooming highlights and shallow depth of field. High-angle close-up, static, showing the pilgrim kneeling in prayer before a stained-glass window, their expression serene with closed eyes.
