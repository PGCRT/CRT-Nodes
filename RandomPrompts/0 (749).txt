(Surreal) A beautiful woman in a flowing red dress walks on the surface of a perfectly still, mirror-like lake in a desolate landscape under a purple sky with two moons. The camera is positioned upside down, so it appears she is walking on the sky among the moons and clouds, her reflection walking on the 'ground' below her. Slow-motion, painterly aesthetic, dreamlike and unsettling.
